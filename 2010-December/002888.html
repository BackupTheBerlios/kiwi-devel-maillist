<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I understand your goal thanks for explaining it more detailed. I read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the code with what you've said in mind and found that there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several places in kiwi which needs a real cleanup first before we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proceed to turn the XML object into a simple data container. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, how can I help with that?
</I>
I will do that per todays git push. You will find the following
XML instances in the code after it:

* kiwi.pl

  - for cache mode, requires state
  - for prepare mode, requires state
  - for create mode, requires state
  - for testsuite mode, required state
  - for upgrade mode, requires state
  - for list-xml info, requires state
  - for list-images, stateless

* KIWIImage.pm::checkAndSetupPrebuiltBootImage()

  - for setting up the boot image, requires state

* KIWIBoot.pm::KIWIBoot

  - reading the image description from root tree,
    image file or disk file. requires state

So if we change the XML all of these places has to be adapted.
I suggest the following way:

   my $xml = new KIWIXML ( ... );
   $xml -&gt; ...

   change to:

   my $xmldata = new KIWIXML ( ... );
   my $xml = new KIWIXMLManager ( ..., $xmldata );

   $xml -&gt; ...

The KIWIXMLManager instance should provide all functions formerly
accessed by the KIWIXML object in order to keep the patch small and
the system still running. There are plenty of $xml -&gt; function()
calls which all have to be handled by the stateful object

&gt;<i> Yes, I absolutely agree. In the end there should probably be only two
</I>&gt;<i> instantiations of the XML object. One for the system, i.e. the user
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml and one for the boot image. Both of these instantiations
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the build manager I have been advocating.
</I>
Well there are a few more because kiwi has several more modes
than just prepare and create. I want these modes to stay independent
which means it must be possible to call them without a previosly
created XML instance. So they need to be able to create their own
XML object. If the change we discuss here is done we might come
back to this one 

&gt;<i> Sounds like we are on the same page now. I like BuildMgr better as this
</I>&gt;<i> indicates it manages a process rather than a single task, but I am OK
</I>&gt;<i> with Build.
</I>
Well I don't like the abbreviation &quot;mgr&quot; for manager and we also have
KIWIManager in place. So if ok with you use &quot;KIWIXMLManager.pm&quot;

&gt;<i> My previous patches were basically an attempt to get us to this type of
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. As we have to get there gradually. A rip and replace
</I>&gt;<i> approach will IMHO not work as we'd have to do a deep dive for a month
</I>&gt;<i> or so where we'd get nothing out the door. I don't think that would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good approach.
</I>
I agree and that's also my biggest concern here. I can't afford an
entire rewrite which it is if we follow all suggestions :-) I will
prepare the KIWIXML code in a way that it contains all XML data which
it currently doesn't due to the possible pre-selection done by profile(s).
If I finsihed that work you can start to write the new KIWIXMLManager
(or whatever name we agree on) code. I will drop you a note when I'm
done

Testing can be done in one mode for example the prepare mode.
That should just be a replacement of a few lines and if we are there
we switch in one step.

I need to review the validator patch and I'm on business travel
next week. So I'm rather busy but I want to be finished with all
the preparations in order to give you a good start for the
KIWIXML / KIWIXMLManager change

Would that be ok for you ?

Regards,
Marcus
