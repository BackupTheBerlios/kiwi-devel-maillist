</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, how can I help with that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will do that per todays git push. You will find the following
</I>&gt;<i> XML instances in the code after it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * kiwi.pl
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - for cache mode, requires state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for prepare mode, requires state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for create mode, requires state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for testsuite mode, required state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for upgrade mode, requires state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for list-xml info, requires state
</I>&gt;<i>   - for list-images, stateless
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * KIWIImage.pm::checkAndSetupPrebuiltBootImage()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - for setting up the boot image, requires state
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * KIWIBoot.pm::KIWIBoot
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - reading the image description from root tree,
</I>&gt;<i>     image file or disk file. requires state
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if we change the XML all of these places has to be adapted.
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest the following way:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    my $xml = new KIWIXML ( ... );
</I>&gt;<i>    $xml -&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    change to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    my $xmldata = new KIWIXML ( ... );
</I>&gt;<i>    my $xml = new KIWIXMLManager ( ..., $xmldata );
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    $xml -&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The KIWIXMLManager instance should provide all functions formerly
</I>&gt;<i> accessed by the KIWIXML object in order to keep the patch small and
</I>&gt;<i> the system still running. There are plenty of $xml -&gt; function()
</I>&gt;<i> calls which all have to be handled by the stateful object
</I>
Now I am seriously confused. I am not following how an extra indirection
through the XMLManager is helpful. The state of the project execution
has nothing to do with the XML. I agree that we need an object that
knows about state, but XMLManager would imply that XML files are being
managed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I absolutely agree. In the end there should probably be only two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instantiations of the XML object. One for the system, i.e. the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config.xml and one for the boot image. Both of these instantiations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be in the build manager I have been advocating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well there are a few more because kiwi has several more modes
</I>&gt;<i> than just prepare and create. I want these modes to stay independent
</I>&gt;<i> which means it must be possible to call them without a previosly
</I>&gt;<i> created XML instance. So they need to be able to create their own
</I>&gt;<i> XML object. If the change we discuss here is done we might come
</I>&gt;<i> back to this one 
</I>
I agree that each state/mode needs to be independent of other modes
states. From an XML point of view there are still only 2 descriptions,
the user defined config.xml and the Kiwi supplied boot image
description. The object that knows the state and controls the process
execution knows how to instantiate the XML object for each file and then
passes the appropriate XML object instance into the &quot;worker&quot;. For
example when it is time to create the boot image the controller passes
the XML object instantiated with the config.xml from the appropriate
boot description.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds like we are on the same page now. I like BuildMgr better as this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicates it manages a process rather than a single task, but I am OK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with Build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well I don't like the abbreviation &quot;mgr&quot; for manager and we also have
</I>&gt;<i> KIWIManager in place. So if ok with you use &quot;KIWIXMLManager.pm&quot;
</I>
I think the current KIWIManager should be a KIWIPackageManager (yes I am
being nit picky, sorry) and as mentioned above I do not think that
KIWIXMLManager is the best choice for our stateful object.

A build manager/build controller/execution manager/some_other_name
should IMHO hold the state. In main this would look like this:

if (defined $Prepare) {
    my $mgr = new KIWIBuildController(....);
    $mgr-&gt;prepare();
}

This controller would also have methods for create and cache setup.
Somewhere along the line we'll need an ExtractKernel method on some
object to avoid playing the nasty XML modification trick being played in
main today that changes the selected file system to avoid the kernel
extraction. The listing my be another object, not sure about that. For
testing purposes I am not sure we really want this in the main kiwi driver.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My previous patches were basically an attempt to get us to this type of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation. As we have to get there gradually. A rip and replace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach will IMHO not work as we'd have to do a deep dive for a month
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or so where we'd get nothing out the door. I don't think that would be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree and that's also my biggest concern here. I can't afford an
</I>&gt;<i> entire rewrite which it is if we follow all suggestions :-) 
</I>
Well, yes I know ultimately I am pushing for major upheaval in the code
with many, maybe most parts re-written or re-arranged. Well, you know
what they say, throw the first design and implementation away ;)
(Sometimes one even has to throw two away).

&gt;<i> I will
</I>&gt;<i> prepare the KIWIXML code in a way that it contains all XML data which
</I>&gt;<i> it currently doesn't due to the possible pre-selection done by profile(s).
</I>&gt;<i> If I finsihed that work you can start to write the new KIWIXMLManager
</I>&gt;<i> (or whatever name we agree on) code. I will drop you a note when I'm
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>
OK, hope you can use some of the stuff I proposed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Testing can be done in one mode for example the prepare mode.
</I>&gt;<i> That should just be a replacement of a few lines and if we are there
</I>&gt;<i> we switch in one step.
</I>
Sounds good.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to review the validator patch and I'm on business travel
</I>&gt;<i> next week. So I'm rather busy but I want to be finished with all
</I>&gt;<i> the preparations in order to give you a good start for the
</I>&gt;<i> KIWIXML / KIWIXMLManager change
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would that be ok for you ?
</I>
Sure.

Thanks,
Robert
