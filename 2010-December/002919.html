<PRE>HI,

I think there exists a good and valid use case where users need/want
special/extra stuff in the initrd. We had this issue recently come up at
EMC and I have also had this while working on a project with IBM.

Naturally we want the image initrd as small as possible for performance
reasons and thus the clean up kiwi performs today is a good feature.
However, it is at the same time an annoying feature when something out
of the ordinary is needed in the initrd. Having given this some thought
I think the issue mostly occurs with OEM images and where one needs
special features in the initrd. Therefore, I think it would be nice if
we would add an option to kiwi that allows users to generate two initrd
images, one that gets used when booting from CD/DVD/USB and the other
the regular initrd that is basically the same as we have today.

My thought is that we would have a installbootinclude=&quot;true/false&quot;
attribute and once this is set kiwi would generate an initrd that
contains this package or archive, no questions ask, i.e. no cleanup
performed. This initrd is then the one that ends up as the initrd of the
live image created that does the installation. The initrd that is
included in the image that gets dumped to disk would be different and is
equivalent to what we do today.

Thoughts/Comments?

Thanks,
Robert
