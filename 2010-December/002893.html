<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> &gt; The KIWIXMLManager instance should provide all functions formerly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accessed by the KIWIXML object in order to keep the patch small and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the system still running. There are plenty of $xml -&gt; function()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calls which all have to be handled by the stateful object
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I am seriously confused. I am not following how an extra indirection
</I>&gt;<i> through the XMLManager is helpful. The state of the project execution
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with the XML. I agree that we need an object that
</I>&gt;<i> knows about state, but XMLManager would imply that XML files are being
</I>&gt;<i> managed.
</I>
Robert, just pick a name and I will be fine with everything you
choose :-))

&gt;<i> I agree that each state/mode needs to be independent of other modes
</I>&gt;<i> states. From an XML point of view there are still only 2 descriptions,
</I>&gt;<i> the user defined config.xml and the Kiwi supplied boot image
</I>&gt;<i> description. The object that knows the state and controls the process
</I>&gt;<i> execution knows how to instantiate the XML object for each file and then
</I>&gt;<i> passes the appropriate XML object instance into the &quot;worker&quot;. For
</I>&gt;<i> example when it is time to create the boot image the controller passes
</I>&gt;<i> the XML object instantiated with the config.xml from the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> boot description.
</I>
That's ok but I think for the moment we can live with the 'manual'
created instances of XML objects and their managing part. If we have
that we can think of making the manager more intelligent 

&gt;<i> A build manager/build controller/execution manager/some_other_name
</I>&gt;<i> should IMHO hold the state. In main this would look like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if (defined $Prepare) {
</I>&gt;<i>     my $mgr = new KIWIBuildController(....);
</I>&gt;<i>     $mgr-&gt;prepare();
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
you would need that in all places where we have a &quot;new KIWIXML&quot;
at the moment. So yes at some places in main but also the ones
in KIWIImage and KIWIBoot as I tried to mention in my last mail

&gt;<i> This controller would also have methods for create and cache setup.
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere along the line we'll need an ExtractKernel method on some
</I>&gt;<i> object to avoid playing the nasty XML modification trick being played in
</I>&gt;<i> main today
</I>
that trick is gone now. I check the mode now. If we are in
InitCache mode some actions are prevented

&gt;<i> Well, yes I know ultimately I am pushing for major upheaval in the code
</I>&gt;<i> with many, maybe most parts re-written or re-arranged. Well, you know
</I>&gt;<i> what they say, throw the first design and implementation away ;)
</I>&gt;<i> (Sometimes one even has to throw two away).
</I>
Well the code is not in that bad shape that a rewrite is required.
All the changes we are about to make or still have done don't have a
benefit on the appliance creation side or are visible to the user.
They are internal changes and should make developers live easier
which is good but imho not enough for an entire rewrite.

&gt;<i> OK, hope you can use some of the stuff I proposed.
</I>
I already was inspired by that :) Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
