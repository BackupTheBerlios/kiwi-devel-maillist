OK, how can I help with that?

&gt;<i> I have

</I>
Yes, I absolutely agree. In the end there should probably be only two
instantiations of the XML object. One for the system, i.e. the user
config.xml and one for the boot image. Both of these instantiations
should be in the build manager I have been advocating.

&gt;<i> which I think makes it
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to add the big change without creating too much regressions
</I>&gt;<i> and new bugs. I fear the stability will really suffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you want to remove the state from KIWIXML and also want to introduce
</I>&gt;<i> accessor methods for all the XML data, another place to implement
</I>&gt;<i> that is required. Your patch adds all that in the main code which I

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    KIWIXML (with state) -&gt; getHash -&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be nice to have something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    KIWIXML (just data)  -&gt; KIWIBuild (with state) -&gt; getX
</I>&gt;<i>                                                   -&gt; getY 
</I>&gt;<i>                                                   -&gt; getHash
</I>&gt;<i>                                                   -&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I have reduced the amount of new KIWIXML instances by
</I>&gt;<i> cleaning up the code it would be more easy to change from stateful
</I>&gt;<i> KIWIXML object to stateless combined with a KIWIBuild object
</I>&gt;<i> which holds the state and controlls the data access. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> care much for the name but I think it would be good to have
</I>&gt;<i> the code in a new module. In my example it would be 'KIWIBuild.pm'
</I>
Sounds like we are on the same page now. I like BuildMgr better as this
indicates it manages a process rather than a single task, but I am OK
with Build.

My idea of the build manager was to unload a bunch of stuff from main.
Some of the state that is currently in XML would also move into the
manager, other state from the XML needs to move somewhere else.

One example is the location of the boot description, this should move
into the boot object. No one else really needs to know about this.

I've been working on a &quot;from scratch&quot; XML object of and on over the last
couple of days while I had some time. The intention with this was to
show in code more clearly the way I see the XML object as a data container.

Note in this implementation I have removed the validation into it's own
object. This change can be easily implemented in the current code base
and I will submit a patch for this hopefully today, if not over the
weekend. (done)

The KIWIXML.pm file attached has some comments about things to be
probably deleted and other things needing review. The code is simply
intended as a guide and show the overall picture. I think it maybe 50%
there. I've documented the data structures used. One of the themes is
that any data that may have the profiles attribute is stored in the
imageConfig hash (named typeInfo in my previous patches) keyed by the
profile name. imageConfig is probably still a misnomer, but I didn't
like profileData, because it made me think of just one profile. Maybe
profCollection would be a good name for this hash?

My previous patches were basically an attempt to get us to this type of
implementation. As we have to get there gradually. A rip and replace
approach will IMHO not work as we'd have to do a deep dive for a month
or so where we'd get nothing out the door. I don't think that would be a
good approach.

One approach that might be feasible and that I was trying to follow with
my patches is a parallel implementation, i.e. implement the new XML
stuff alongside the existing implementation and then gradually transform
the code around the new XML. This approach should let us focus on one
part of the code base at a time.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That way we also prevent conflicts while merging in patches and
</I>&gt;<i> we keep main free from functions which imho doesn't belong there
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
Yes :)

main should really just process the command line options and then kick
off the appropriate actions by passing the proper arguments to the
BuildMgr, the XML validator (soon to be a separate object) etc.

Now we're cooking. :)

If you think I should continue with the XML implementation as a pure
data container, i.e. finish the implementation of the attached KIWIXML
file such that we can eventually either cut and paste the code out of
here and insert it into the development branch, or drop the new code in
at some point please let me know.

My next step will be to create the Validator based on the latest push
and add a --check-config option to Kiwi. After that I am not sure
whether or not you want me to just continue whacking at the XML object
or if you think other parts need whacking first.

Very happy to see that you already ripped out the ForeignRepo stuff out
of the XML. :)

Please let me know where I should poke around next.

Thanks,
Robert
