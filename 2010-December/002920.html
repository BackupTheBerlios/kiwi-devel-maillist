<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I think there exists a good and valid use case where users need/want
</I>&gt;<i> special/extra stuff in the initrd. We had this issue recently come up at
</I>&gt;<i> EMC and I have also had this while working on a project with IBM.
</I>
Those issues were I also was part of the discussion ends all with
the agreement that this does not belong to the initrd or should be
at least part of the pre-init code but better run as part of a
runlevel script. The problems related to missing drivers due the
fact that they are propriatery could all be solved by a custom
kmp package or archive which was bootincluded
 
If the user need/want special/extra stuff which is beyond the
purpose of the provided initrd code in terms of changing the
current behavior or adding extensively more code a clone of the
initrd should be created:

   kiwi --clone oemboot/suse-11.3/ -d /tmp/myoem

inside the /tmp/myoem/images.sh the user can easily prevent
the strip down of the initrd by not calling suseStripInitrd()
for example. The initrd code and everything else can also be
changed like the user or our consultants wants it.

&gt;<i> Naturally we want the image initrd as small as possible for performance
</I>&gt;<i> reasons and thus the clean up kiwi performs today is a good feature.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is at the same time an annoying feature when something out
</I>&gt;<i> of the ordinary is needed in the initrd. Having given this some thought
</I>&gt;<i> I think the issue mostly occurs with OEM images and where one needs
</I>&gt;<i> special features in the initrd. Therefore, I think it would be nice if
</I>&gt;<i> we would add an option to kiwi that allows users to generate two initrd
</I>&gt;<i> images, one that gets used when booting from CD/DVD/USB and the other
</I>&gt;<i> the regular initrd that is basically the same as we have today.
</I>
If I understand you correctly you want to differentiate between
the oem install initrd and the oem first boot initrd. The problem here
is that I really enjoy the fact that they are sharing the same base
especially for debugging problems and to avoid more bugs in that
area.

&gt;<i> My thought is that we would have a installbootinclude=&quot;true/false&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute and once this is set kiwi would generate an initrd that
</I>&gt;<i> contains this package or archive, no questions ask, i.e. no cleanup
</I>&gt;<i> performed. This initrd is then the one that ends up as the initrd of the
</I>&gt;<i> live image created that does the installation. The initrd that is
</I>&gt;<i> included in the image that gets dumped to disk would be different and is
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to what we do today.
</I>
The really annoying part is that suseStripInitrd() might remove what
has been added via a bootincluded archive or package. A good
improvement here would be to make sure that suseStripInitrd() does
not remove stuff added by a bootincluded archive or package so
that the user can be sure all his data is there.
I opened bug #660743 for this one

But after that it's still not guaranteed that the included programs
work because of the strip down, required libraries and other data
might be gone. So if the included data requires this a clone of
the initrd seems to be better

Regards,
Marcus
