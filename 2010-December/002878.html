<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> Well, setCurrentBuildInfo really represents the spirit of the changes I
</I>&gt;<i> would like us to make. The XML object prior to this patch and still now
</I>&gt;<i> holds state information, i.e. the XML object knows what image type is
</I>&gt;<i> currently being built and what profiles apply. However, IMHO this should
</I>&gt;<i> not be. The XML object should only hold and represent the data as it is
</I>&gt;<i> encoded in config.xml. All the data in XML, not selectively load some data.
</I>
I understand your goal thanks for explaining it more detailed. I read
through the code with what you've said in mind and found that there are
several places in kiwi which needs a real cleanup first before we can
proceed to turn the XML object into a simple data container. I have
started to cleanup the situation around KIWIImage.pm (see the current push)
and I will proceed with KIWIBoot the next days. Basically there are too
many instances of KIWIXML objects in place which I think makes it
impossible to add the big change without creating too much regressions
and new bugs. I fear the stability will really suffer.

As you want to remove the state from KIWIXML and also want to introduce
accessor methods for all the XML data, another place to implement
that is required. Your patch adds all that in the main code which I
think is not the right place. At the moment the situation is:

   KIWIXML (with state) -&gt; getHash -&gt; ...

I think it would be nice to have something like this:

   KIWIXML (just data)  -&gt; KIWIBuild (with state) -&gt; getX
                                                  -&gt; getY 
                                                  -&gt; getHash
                                                  -&gt; ...

If I have reduced the amount of new KIWIXML instances by
cleaning up the code it would be more easy to change from stateful
KIWIXML object to stateless combined with a KIWIBuild object
which holds the state and controlls the data access. I don't
care much for the name but I think it would be good to have
the code in a new module. In my example it would be 'KIWIBuild.pm'

That way we also prevent conflicts while merging in patches and
we keep main free from functions which imho doesn't belong there
What do you think ?

Regards,
Marcus
