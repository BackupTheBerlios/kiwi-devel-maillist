<PRE>Hi Marcus,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> I was able to build the suse-11.3/suse-oem-preload example with some
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the patch you attached. Using all of the patch makes it fail
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't took a closer look why because I had a few concerns while
</I>&gt;<i> reading the patch before. Here are the good news first:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * I added the uninitialized value patch in a single commit
</I>&gt;<i> * I added __checkTypeUnique in a single commit
</I>
Thanks,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The rest is only added in parts and I also added some additions.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still concerned about the setCurrentBuildInfo() change and I
</I>&gt;<i> also did not understand why it's required to do it that way. 
</I>
Well, setCurrentBuildInfo really represents the spirit of the changes I
would like us to make. The XML object prior to this patch and still now
holds state information, i.e. the XML object knows what image type is
currently being built and what profiles apply. However, IMHO this should
not be. The XML object should only hold and represent the data as it is
encoded in config.xml. All the data in XML, not selectively load some data.

Following this approach (everything is loaded, not state information in
XML) will allow us to pull out special casing for the boot image
creation. Once KIWIXML.pm only holds data as specified in config.xml and
the state is held by someone else (main at present) then creating the
boot image is no longer something special as it is at present. This is
the reason that the data structure in my patch was based of the profiles
data and all profiles were added to the typeinfo hash.

The patch as applied doesn't really get us closer to the &quot;no state in
KIWIXML&quot; idea. I suspect I didn't explain that idea properly, sorry. :(

&gt;<i> Don't
</I>&gt;<i> get me wrong I'm fine having accessor methods and a XML object
</I>&gt;<i> which doesn't have a method changing the data set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> According to that I added your KIWIXML changes but not the change
</I>&gt;<i> in kiwi.pl and also modified the KIWIXML change to what I think
</I>&gt;<i> we want to achieve. Here are the details:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I restructured the XML data processing by adding the following
</I>&gt;<i> KIWIXML methods:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    __populateTypeInfo() and
</I>&gt;<i>    __populateImageTypeAndNode()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first method creates the %typeInfo hash which contains all
</I>&gt;<i> possible &lt;type&gt; elements according to the selected profiles.
</I>
The selected profiles information is state, answering to the question
&quot;what are we building?&quot;. The XML object is not the object that should
answer that question. The XML object should only answer questions like
&quot;what is configured for this type?&quot; Not whether the given type is what
we are currently building.

State is a higher level concept and the XML object really should not
care about the state. The XML object only needs to answer questions
about the configuration.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second method operates on the %typeInfo hash and initializes
</I>&gt;<i> those part of the hash which represents the requested image type
</I>&gt;<i> or the primary type or the first type read in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Both methodes are called only _once_ inside the object constructor
</I>&gt;<i> * The existing method getImageTypeAndAttributes() has changed to
</I>&gt;<i>   simply return the selected part of the %typeInfo hash and does
</I>&gt;<i>   NOT change any object data as done before.
</I>
Yes, I wasn't ready for that in the &quot;no state paradigm&quot;. That's why I
hadn't proceeded with this step, or even ripping out
getImageTypeAndAttributes() completely.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I think the XML object creation is sane now and we
</I>&gt;<i> can focus on writing the accessor functions which imho also belongs
</I>&gt;<i> to KIWIXML
</I>
Sorry, I disagree, because of the state that is still in the XML object.

Another example of the state in the XML object is that we pass profiles
into the XML constructor. This argument should not be there. KIWIXML
simply populates itself from the information in config.xml. Then the
code that holds state, ideally only a manager/driver object (not main
preferably in the long run) asks XML to hand out data for what is
currently being built. Thus XML is completely oblivious to the state.

Taking the next step in what my patch was intended to initiate would be
to have a method as follows:

my @imagePckgs = $xml -&gt; getPackageList ( @Profiles );

The XML object does not need any knowledge about the state, it just gets
asked &quot;hand me the packages for the profile(s) I want to use&quot;. It
doesn't get much simpler than that. There will also be a need for

$xml -&gt; getBootPackageList ( @Profiles )

that delivers all package names that are marked as &quot;bootinclude&quot;.

After we get rid of the state in XML we can probably get rid of all XML
instantiations in Boot.pm, Image.pm and other places. We can also look
at creating a KIWIBuildMgr object and unload a lot of responsibility out
of main, with this we'll be able to get rid of the recursive call of
kiwi onto itself and rip out all the stuff that goes with it, the
survive checks etc. The KIWIBuildMgr then holds all the state and every
other object is completely oblivious to the build state. All objects,
other than the BuildMgr, just get handed an XML object, profiles, and a
type; that's it. Each object operates with the information given and
does not need to derive anything at all. Overall I am convinced this
will lead to a great simplification of the code, we'll be able to reduce
code duplication ....

Lset but not least, and object that has no state, such as XML should be
in my mind is easy to unit test. I can write a simple test driver that
instantiates the XML object and feeds it one config file after another.
Then I can probe the object and make sure I get back what I expect.
Testing objects that have state in such a fashion is much more difficult
and error prone.

Not sure if I should try and mold the latest tree. It appears easier to
me to pull this last patch (spare the additional consistency check, and
the fix for &quot;no type in the first preferences section&quot;). Then go back
and get the original patch to work and get it in. Or maybe we need some
more discussion on the concepts behind the patch.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Robert
