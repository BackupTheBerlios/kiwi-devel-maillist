Great.

I will wait until you have the changes in the master branch before I
make more changes in this area.

&gt;<i> But this

I'll be there, virtually. Will be living on German time for a week.

&gt;<i>

I will try my best not to touch the data structures.

Thanks and sorry for generating extra work on your part. I was hoping to
push this effort without you having to do a lot of extra work; you have
plenty of work on your plate as it is. Unfortunately that didn't quite
work out as planned.

Robert
