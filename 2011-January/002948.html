<PRE>Hi,

The attached patch should contain the changes as discussed.

Thanks,
Robert

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, changing the KIWIXML ctor arguments is inevitable. Once we remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the state from the XML object the imageType and reqProfiles arguments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will no longer be necessary to construct an XML object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yes but removing ctor arguments directly leads to errors if one
</I>&gt;<i> is using the object in the wrong way but changing the meaning of
</I>&gt;<i> an argument could cause regressions and weird behaviour which is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to find and hard to debug. removing stuff is not a problem
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we think about this from a bottom line/minimalist perspective, all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that should be needed to construct the XML object is the path to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control file (and the message logging object). Everything else is fluff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be great to get to the point of a 2 argument XML object
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;new KIWIXML(KIWI_LOG, CONTROL_FILE)&quot;, it doesn't get much cleaner and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nicer than that. Even the validation of the XML can and probably should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be offloaded from the XML object. The object can certainly reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect that the file given to it is valid and consistent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if we reach that point when KIWIXML is so simple that you also
</I>&gt;<i> can move out the validation from the constructor we can move
</I>&gt;<i> out the config file locator call too. I think at that point we also
</I>&gt;<i> can evaluate the impact of changing the meaning of the ctor
</I>&gt;<i> arguments. At the moment I'm convinced it's not a good idea to
</I>&gt;<i> change the meaning of the KIWIXML argument list
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I realize this looks horrible now with calls to getControlFile()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> littered all over the code. However, don't forget that in the end there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be a lot fewer instantiations of the XML object (I'm still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking 3 or 4, and all of those in one central place) and thus this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will clean itself up automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry but I disagree. Over years of working in development projects
</I>&gt;<i> things never cleaned up themselves automatically :) It was
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately most often the other way round
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With that said, if you want a call to getControlFile() in the XML ctor,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than changing the argument at this point I can certainly rework
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the patch. However, it is inevitable that at some point we will reach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this pint again, and thus have to revisit this discussion. As mentioned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above the arguments of the XML ctor will need to change if we want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remove the state from the XML object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree and I'm sure if we re-enter this discussion the code will have
</I>&gt;<i> been improved and cleaned up which will make it easier to make the
</I>&gt;<i> decision at that time. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - You are introducing a new KIWIXMLLocator module which is great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - We will move out some code parts and duplications when calling
</I>&gt;<i>    getControlFile() which is also a step into the right direction
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - We will find a solution for the md5 check ;)
</I>&gt;<i>    see my next comment
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and that's a good patch for this restructuring round to become
</I>&gt;<i> checked in. What do you think ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You are right that includes other than XML files but it also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> includes the XML file itself. I'm not sure if we have to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be that strict here ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should be. I am convinced that a better place than kiwi.pl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will emerge for this function. I consider putting this function into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kiwi.pl an eyesore and I agree with you that it should not live there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I also feel quite strongly that it should not be mingled in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the XML validation as it really has nothing to do with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validation step of the control file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I agree here. So let us create a function for the md5 check
</I>&gt;<i> and put it into kiwi.pl. The md5 check makes only sense in kiwi's
</I>&gt;<i> prepare mode anyway so it is called too often at the moment. Would
</I>&gt;<i> be good if we just place one call inside the $Prepare block
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Marcus
