</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Notes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - inserted a call to checkImageIntegrity() for most calls to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   &quot;new KIWIXML&quot; some of these are probably not necessary. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   overkill on calls preserves parity to the current behavior.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The extraneous calls should be cleaned up at some point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We lost the calls to Carp::longmess() in getControlFile with the move of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the function from kiwi.pl to KIWILocator.pm. KIWILocator will also need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to gain a function to find the boot image description. But I have not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> searched the code where this is currently implemented.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once the Locator has the &quot;find boot image&quot; functionality we can use it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the XMLValidator to make sure we can find the specified image. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validation is currently not possible. However, having a typo in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> string can be very expensive as the problem is only detected at image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creation time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I have some questions about this one:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's true that there is kiwi.pl and KIWIXML.pm which does the
</I>&gt;<i>    check for an alternative XML control file. So moving that into
</I>&gt;<i>    a function into a KIWILocator module is fine. But I don't
</I>&gt;<i>    understand why you duplicated the call getControlFile() that many
</I>&gt;<i>    times. Just replacing the two locations 1) kiwi.pl and 2)
</I>&gt;<i>    KIWIXML constructor by a function call seems better and less
</I>&gt;<i>    intrusive to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm also concerned (and don't understand the reason why) about
</I>&gt;<i>    the change from the XML object parameter 'path to image description'
</I>&gt;<i>    into 'path to control file'. This could create many regressions
</I>&gt;<i>    and bugs which we are not able to cover in any test matrix. Because
</I>&gt;<i>    the first is a directory path and the second is a file path.
</I>&gt;<i>    I always try to avoid such changes whenever possible. And in this
</I>&gt;<i>    special case I also don't see an advantage
</I>
It all goes back to the attempt of turning KIWIXML into a mostly dumb
container object with no knowledge of state or other things, and letting
knowledge such as control file name and state be managed by objects
external to KIWIXML. If we leave 'path to image description' as the
argument then KIWIXML has to know to look for config.xml or an alternate
name. However, if the argument is 'path to control file' than the XML
object does not need to know anything about the name. All KIWIXML has to
know is:

1.) open the file I am given
2.) validate
3.) populate myself

(this applies after the state has been removed from KIWIXML). further,
there is no other data in the image description that is useful/required
for KIWIXML to do it's job. Thus, providing the directory location
instead of just the control file location provides too much information
to the KIWIXML object.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) KIWILocator is a container module it's not possible to
</I>&gt;<i>    create a KIWILocator object because it's not blessed and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>    provide a constructor. It would be good if the module has the
</I>&gt;<i>    same structure like all others
</I>
At this point I do not see the need for object data for the Locator.
Thus, I did not create a class, but rather the module as a collector for
functions. It could be that the implementation of the &quot;boot description
location&quot; function requires object data in the form of the hard coded
/usr/share/kiwi/image/ path, but as I didn't implement this location
function/method yet I thought an object implementation for the current
Locator was overkill at this point.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) why can't the md5 hash check go into KIWIXMLValidator::validate() ?
</I>
Because the md5 validation has nothing to do with XML validation. The
md5 validation works on the image description not the XML and the
KIWIXMLValidator should only validate the XML, nothing else. I am
certain a better place than kiwi.pl will emerge for this function at
some point.

&gt;<i>    we do more than just an XML validation here we also check the
</I>&gt;<i>    consistency 
</I>
But only consistency of the content of the XML file, not anything else
in the image description.

&gt;<i>    so I don't see any problem adding the md5 check there
</I>&gt;<i>    too. 
</I>
IMHO that would be mingling of concerns, something we should try to avoid.
