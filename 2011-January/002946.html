<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Well, changing the KIWIXML ctor arguments is inevitable. Once we remove
</I>&gt;<i> the state from the XML object the imageType and reqProfiles arguments
</I>&gt;<i> will no longer be necessary to construct an XML object.
</I>
yes but removing ctor arguments directly leads to errors if one
is using the object in the wrong way but changing the meaning of
an argument could cause regressions and weird behaviour which is
hard to find and hard to debug. removing stuff is not a problem

&gt;<i> If we think about this from a bottom line/minimalist perspective, all
</I>&gt;<i> that should be needed to construct the XML object is the path to the
</I>&gt;<i> control file (and the message logging object). Everything else is fluff.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be great to get to the point of a 2 argument XML object
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new KIWIXML(KIWI_LOG, CONTROL_FILE)&quot;, it doesn't get much cleaner and
</I>&gt;<i> nicer than that. Even the validation of the XML can and probably should
</I>&gt;<i> be offloaded from the XML object. The object can certainly reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> expect that the file given to it is valid and consistent.
</I>
if we reach that point when KIWIXML is so simple that you also
can move out the validation from the constructor we can move
out the config file locator call too. I think at that point we also
can evaluate the impact of changing the meaning of the ctor
arguments. At the moment I'm convinced it's not a good idea to
change the meaning of the KIWIXML argument list

&gt;<i> I realize this looks horrible now with calls to getControlFile()
</I>&gt;<i> littered all over the code. However, don't forget that in the end there
</I>&gt;<i> should be a lot fewer instantiations of the XML object (I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> thinking 3 or 4, and all of those in one central place) and thus this
</I>&gt;<i> will clean itself up automatically.
</I>
I'm sorry but I disagree. Over years of working in development projects
things never cleaned up themselves automatically :) It was
unfortunately most often the other way round

&gt;<i> With that said, if you want a call to getControlFile() in the XML ctor,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than changing the argument at this point I can certainly rework
</I>&gt;<i> the patch. However, it is inevitable that at some point we will reach
</I>&gt;<i> this pint again, and thus have to revisit this discussion. As mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above the arguments of the XML ctor will need to change if we want to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the state from the XML object.
</I>
I agree and I'm sure if we re-enter this discussion the code will have
been improved and cleaned up which will make it easier to make the
decision at that time. 

 - You are introducing a new KIWIXMLLocator module which is great.

 - We will move out some code parts and duplications when calling
   getControlFile() which is also a step into the right direction

 - We will find a solution for the md5 check ;)
   see my next comment

and that's a good patch for this restructuring round to become
checked in. What do you think ?

&gt;<i> &gt; You are right that includes other than XML files but it also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes the XML file itself. I'm not sure if we have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be that strict here ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should be. I am convinced that a better place than kiwi.pl
</I>&gt;<i> will emerge for this function. I consider putting this function into
</I>&gt;<i> kiwi.pl an eyesore and I agree with you that it should not live there.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I also feel quite strongly that it should not be mingled in
</I>&gt;<i> with the XML validation as it really has nothing to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> validation step of the control file.
</I>
Ok, I agree here. So let us create a function for the md5 check
and put it into kiwi.pl. The md5 check makes only sense in kiwi's
prepare mode anyway so it is called too often at the moment. Would
be good if we just place one call inside the $Prepare block

Regards,
Marcus
