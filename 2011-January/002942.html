<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> It all goes back to the attempt of turning KIWIXML into a mostly dumb
</I>&gt;<i> container object with no knowledge of state or other things, and letting
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge such as control file name and state be managed by objects
</I>&gt;<i> external to KIWIXML. If we leave 'path to image description' as the
</I>&gt;<i> argument then KIWIXML has to know to look for config.xml or an alternate
</I>&gt;<i> name. However, if the argument is 'path to control file' than the XML
</I>&gt;<i> object does not need to know anything about the name. All KIWIXML has to
</I>&gt;<i> know is:
</I>
ok, but that doesn't mean that we have to change the parameter
types of the XML object constructor. I don't see anything evil
if the XML object constructor creates a XMLLocator object asking
it for the file name of the xml it should read. Or if you don't
want to create an object it would also be ok to call the exported
XMLLocator function directly as you do it currently in kiwi.pl

As I said I don't want to change the meaning of constructor
parameters and I think that's not against the attempt of turning
KIWIXML into a mostly dumb container. The KIWIXML constructor
also creates a KIWIXMLValidator object and calls validate()
imho you can do the same with the KIWIXMLLocator and call locate()
That also would follow the nature of the rest of the code because
I did not work much with module exported anyonymous functions
(which of course is ok too)

&gt;<i> At this point I do not see the need for object data for the Locator.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, I did not create a class, but rather the module as a collector for
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>
That's ok but the module should be prepared as a class just
for the following reasons:

 - consistency: all other modules are implemented as a class
 - future code in that module might turn it into a class which
   might have to manage named data

just add a simply new method and bless it as done in the other
modules. it will not strike back :)

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) why can't the md5 hash check go into KIWIXMLValidator::validate() ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the md5 validation has nothing to do with XML validation. The
</I>&gt;<i> md5 validation works on the image description not the XML and the
</I>&gt;<i> KIWIXMLValidator should only validate the XML, nothing else. I am
</I>&gt;<i> certain a better place than kiwi.pl will emerge for this function at
</I>&gt;<i> some point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    we do more than just an XML validation here we also check the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    consistency 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But only consistency of the content of the XML file, not anything else
</I>&gt;<i> in the image description.
</I>
Hmm, inside the KIWIXMLValidator we do checks like:

 - search for the kiwi revision file
 - search for the schema file
 - search for the xslt master file
 
why is it that bad to check the md5 sum of the description ?
You are right that includes other than XML files but it also
includes the XML file itself. I'm not sure if we have to
be that strict here ?

What would be the negative effect to have the md5 check as
part of the validation and consistency except that we are not
100% in the scope of XML files ?

Regards,
Marcus
