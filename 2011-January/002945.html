Well, changing the KIWIXML ctor arguments is inevitable. Once we remove
the state from the XML object the imageType and reqProfiles arguments
will no longer be necessary to construct an XML object.

If we think about this from a bottom line/minimalist perspective, all
that should be needed to construct the XML object is the path to the
control file (and the message logging object). Everything else is fluff.
I think it would be great to get to the point of a 2 argument XML object
&quot;new KIWIXML(KIWI_LOG, CONTROL_FILE)&quot;, it doesn't get much cleaner and
nicer than that. Even the validation of the XML can and probably should
be offloaded from the XML object. The object can certainly reasonably
expect that the file given to it is valid and consistent.

&gt;<i> The KIWIXML constructor
</I>&gt;<i> also creates a KIWIXMLValidator object and calls validate()
</I>&gt;<i> imho you can do the same with the KIWIXMLLocator and call locate()
</I>&gt;<i> That also would follow the nature of the rest of the code because
</I>&gt;<i> I did not work much with module exported anyonymous functions
</I>&gt;<i> (which of course is ok too)
</I>
I realize this looks horrible now with calls to getControlFile()
littered all over the code. However, don't forget that in the end there
should be a lot fewer instantiations of the XML object (I'm still
thinking 3 or 4, and all of those in one central place) and thus this
will clean itself up automatically.

With that said, if you want a call to getControlFile() in the XML ctor,
rather than changing the argument at this point I can certainly rework
the patch. However, it is inevitable that at some point we will reach
this pint again, and thus have to revisit this discussion. As mentioned
above the arguments of the XML ctor will need to change if we want to
remove the state from the XML object.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At this point I do not see the need for object data for the Locator.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus, I did not create a class, but rather the module as a collector for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's ok but the module should be prepared as a class just
</I>&gt;<i> for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - consistency: all other modules are implemented as a class
</I>&gt;<i>  - future code in that module might turn it into a class which
</I>&gt;<i>    might have to manage named data
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> just add a simply new method and bless it as done in the other
</I>&gt;<i> modules. it will not strike back :)
</I>
OK, I'll make it a class.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) why can't the md5 hash check go into KIWIXMLValidator::validate() ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because the md5 validation has nothing to do with XML validation. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> md5 validation works on the image description not the XML and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> KIWIXMLValidator should only validate the XML, nothing else. I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain a better place than kiwi.pl will emerge for this function at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    we do more than just an XML validation here we also check the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    consistency 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But only consistency of the content of the XML file, not anything else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the image description.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, inside the KIWIXMLValidator we do checks like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - search for the kiwi revision file
</I>
Because the revision can be specified in the XML file via the
kiwirevision attribute.

&gt;<i>  - search for the schema file
</I>
Need to have the schema to validate the XML. Of course we can split the
validator into two, one that does schematic validation and one that does
consistency checking. The consistency checker would no longer need the
schema.

&gt;<i>  - search for the xslt master file
</I>
Need to make sure the XML file is upgraded to the latest schema.
Although, it is very reasonable to argue that it is the clients
responsibility (i.e. anyone using the validator) to assure the XML file
to be validated is upgraded to the latest version.

But in all three cases the validator does not search for the files, the
files are given to it as arguments in the ctor. All the validator does
is check that the ctor arguments are valied, i.e. the files exist.
That's just defensive programming.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> why is it that bad to check the md5 sum of the description ?
</I>
Adding the md5 check to XMLValidator would mean that it has to know
about the image description as a directory rather than just knowing
about the control file.

&gt;<i> You are right that includes other than XML files but it also
</I>&gt;<i> includes the XML file itself. I'm not sure if we have to
</I>&gt;<i> be that strict here ?
</I>
I think we should be. I am convinced that a better place than kiwi.pl
will emerge for this function. I consider putting this function into
kiwi.pl an eyesore and I agree with you that it should not live there.
However, I also feel quite strongly that it should not be mingled in
with the XML validation as it really has nothing to do with the
validation step of the control file.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What would be the negative effect to have the md5 check as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the validation and consistency except that we are not
</I>&gt;<i> 100% in the scope of XML files ?
</I>
Unit testing will be more difficult. While I have not implemented any
unit tests, much to my own dismay, I have given this a fair amount of
thought, especially for the validator. With the current implementation
of the validator, focused solely on the XML, one can prepare one
directory that contains a large number of XML files and feed them one by
one through the validator. Each XML file can be appropriately named to
reflect the test case.

With the exception of the transformation of the config.xml file (as
mentioned above) I think the validator is very focused on one task only,
and thus I think we should not expand it's responsibilities beyond this
tasks.
