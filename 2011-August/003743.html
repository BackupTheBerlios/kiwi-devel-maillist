</I>&gt;<i> nice feature :) I guess if I overwrite the repo data with the

</I>
Should be, but I did not test this behavior. I thought about the command 
line but than chose to ignore it for now until we get a 
complaint/request about the behavior. ;)

</I>&gt;<i> What about local repos like <A HREF="iso://...">iso://...</A> do they end up unmodified

Yes.

</I>
Makes sense to me, it appears perfectly reasonable to include the iso 
image itself in the image. I have one of those images for the KIWI class 
setup.

&gt;<i> Same for local paths smb mounts and any other
</I>&gt;<i> repo type referencing the network the image is being built in
</I>&gt;<i> I guess we will leave it up to the user if it makes sense to have
</I>&gt;<i> that repo as part of the image as well right ?
</I>
Yes, it is completely up to the user. There are no consistency checks, 
warnings etc. The user has to decide what makes sense in their specific 
case. In certain cases I can also envision that the inclusion of smb 
mounted repos would make sense.
