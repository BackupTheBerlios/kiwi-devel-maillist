<PRE>Sorry for the spam. I'm using Groupwise, maybe some options was wrongly configured by me.
It also seems that mail's message body is too big to send to. So, I'd like to paste that mail in
below, and put that patch in the attachment. Thanks:)

Hi Marcus,

When I used kiwi to build a software appliance for SLE HAE 11, I felt a feature may need to add in our kiwi, 
that is, OEM image should support repartition a reserved partition for other use. 
For example, if the customer wants to use DRBD (RAID1 over Ethernet) and if the customer only has one hard 
disk in his machine, because DRBD needs one hard disk or one partition to build the mirrored disk device, 
the customer may need a reserved partition to serve as DRBD data partition, which located in the same hard 
disk with the OS image.
Above is the example for the server user, another example I can think of for the desktop user is the customer 
may want to reserve a partition for later use, such as installing another OS, for me, I installed openSUSE11.1
and SLES10-SP2 on my own laptop.

Here is the patch which is against the kiwi packages in SLE11 GM. I don't know if it makes sense :) 
(If the patch makes sense, I can regenerate a new patch based on the upstream source tree.)

Thanks,
Jiaju
