<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I didn't understand what you meant by, other image types mount the squashed file system and test it. All the mounts during the kiwi build use the build environment's kernel and its modules [openSUSE in my case]. It will not touch the kernel modules of the image [RHEL in my case] that is being built. So, how is the below problem tested in other types of images?
</I>
The problem is this: You know you want to build an image for for example
openSUSE 11.2 and your build system is openSUSE 11.3. The image type you
want to build is a virtual disk let's say for VMware. You also want to
use a compressed split system which brings squashfs on the plan

During the process kiwi creates the squashfs filesystem. At a later
point it also has to mount this filesystem... everything is fine the
image is created but you know you can't boot it because the squashfs
version you built can't be mounted by the older squashfs module of
the openSUSE 11.2 kernel

ok you stumbled over that problem and now you simply downgrade your
squashfs package on your 11.3 build system to the one from 11.2 to
be able to create the older squashfs filesystem format. The problem
now is kiwi can't mount it because the kernel module of your 11.3
build system can't mount the old squashfs filesystem format

... the chicken &amp; egg problem  

basically you also had to downgrade the kernel and reboot or kecec 
the 11.3 system with an older kernel after that it would work...
But who wants that.

Regards,
Marcus
