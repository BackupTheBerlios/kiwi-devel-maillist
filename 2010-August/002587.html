<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The squash versions 3.x and 4.x are not compatible. So, If the build environment (openSUSE 11.3 in my case) has a squash version 4.x installed and the kernel of the image (that is being built, RHEL 5.4 in my case) has 3.x version of the squashfs module, the final live ISO will not boot. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  The error that would pop up because of this failure is : &quot;Failed to mount read only filesystem&quot; which doesn't give much information about what went wrong either :(.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I couldn't come up with a reliable way to check this. The comparison has to be between the version of the &quot;squashfs&quot; kernel module and the version of squashfs rpm used  in the build environment. Did anybody come across this issue?
</I>
I'm aware of that problem, but also don't have a good solution
for it. For iso image types you can install a compatible version of the
mksquashfs tool which works because kiwi doesn't mount the filesystem
in the iso image creation process

for other image types kiwi also mounts the generated squashfs filesystem
and that means the kernel module _and_ the filesystem creation tool
must match the buildsystem but if the later image uses another
squashfs kernel module the mount will fail on boot of that image.
I don't have a solution for this problem :(

Basically I want to use clicfs for live iso's also for RHEL too
but I need to build clicfs for RHEL first and didn't had time
to do it so far. This has some advantages:

- clicfs is an overlay filesystem and would allow complete r/w support
- clicfs is fuse based so the compatibility layer is only on the user
  space side which we can handle better

I'll take a look into that soon

Regards,
Marcus
