+Finally the concept allows users to make their own
 custom plugins for special purposes. This mechanism will be explained in more
-detail in ref:TODO
+detail in \vref{subsec:plugins}.
 
+You need some source directories containing the available RPM files on the very
+same harddisk where you want to create the installation sources. The reason for
+that is the fact that hard links are used to speed up the installation source
+creation. There are plans to integrate support for mixed environments, but those
+have been delayed due to more important issues. If you use a \textit{full
+tree\footnote{a tree containing only RPM files which have been built using no
+other RPMs then those available in the same tree}} be prepared to use 10--10\,GB
+per full tree, so if you build installation sources for multiple architectures
+this may easily sum up to 120\,GB. I recommend at least a 300\,GB harddisk.
 
+It is possible to use a mounted DVD as ``full tree'', but in that case you have
+to get the \textit{meta\-packages} from some other source.

 The interface for installation source creation is implemented in two steps. The

 \section{Calling Options}
 
-TODO
+\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Calling kiwi-isntsource},
+label={lst:nstsource-call}]
+kiwi --root &lt;rootdir&gt; \
+     --instsource-local \
+     --create-instsource &lt;configdir&gt;
+\end{lstlisting}
 
+The most simple call of kiwi-inst\-source is shown in \vref{lst:nstsource-call}.
+Hereby \texttt{root\-dir} refers to the base directory where all operations
+happen. This directory will be created by kiwi. The config directory
+\texttt{con\-fig\-dir} is just the same as in the other kiwi modes, the directory
+where the config.xml file resides.
 
+The option \textit{instsource-local}  has been added to distinguish between the
+local only mode and the remote repository mode. However, as mentioned in
+\vref{sec:prereq} the remote mode is not supported in this version.
+
+There are some more options available, such as the \texttt{-v} switch to
+increase verbosity and the logfile option. % as described in (AI Marcus).
+During development I typically used something like \vref{lst:instsource-call2}.
+
+\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Typical kiwi-isntsource call during
+development},
+label={lst:nstsource-call}]
+kiwi --root 19.01 \
+     -vvv \
+     --logfile terminal \
+     --instsource-local \
+     --create-instsource \
+/space/config/openSUSE\:Factory/_product\:openSUSE-11.2-dvd5-dvd-i586/ \
+     | tee 19.01.log
+\end{lstlisting}
+
+The logfile options effect is that all logging output is written to the shell
+and can be captured easily using the \texttt{tee} command. For debugging it is
+helpful to have a file containing all output for analysis with \texttt{grep} and
+to see the output passing for progress.
+
+The switch \texttt{-v} which can be used multiple times increases logging
+verbosity but slows progress at the same time. Three or more times prints log
+information for each resolved package which is sometimes necessary to identify
+problems in the used repositories. For most purposes two times \texttt{-v} is
+just fine. In this particular example the DVD5 flavour of openSUSE factory was
+built.
