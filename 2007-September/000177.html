Haha.  That is a good point.

Yeah, it has definitely rotted a bit :/

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in any of these cases the isoinstboot mechanism will have

Well, Michele would still like to have a CD-&gt;flash installation method
for the thin client stuff, but it might be better to just have our own
little thing for that instead of a general KIWI initrd.  I would be fine
with removing it as I don't have time to maintain it anyway.

Thanks,
James
