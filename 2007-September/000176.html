<PRE>Hi,

James as you are the original author of the isoinstboot
boot image I would like to ask if you think whether it's still
needed or not. The problem is with the current code I think it
wouldn't work.

The linuxrc file of this boot image assumes that there is
a config.isoclient file which points to the system image file.
The system image file is then &quot;installed&quot; on the previosly 
partitioned disk:

a) I think it's a bit risky to have a CD which completely
   removes the installed system and replaces it with an image
   on CD... maybe people out there will kill us sooner or later
   for this feature :-)
   
b) The process doesn't work for all kinds of live media we support.

   - In case of the old link system only the RAM part stays as
     an image file on the disk the rest is part of the iso file
     system and not available as image file for installation

   - In case of the old link system but with a compressed image
     the read-only and the read-write part are available as image
     files but as far as I understand the linuxrc would install
     only one of the images

   - In case of the new system with aufs/unionfs the complete
     image exists as one file and could be installed but if the
     image is compressed the installation would install a read-only
     root filesystem which can't be mounted by the standard initrd
     of the distribution

So in any of these cases the isoinstboot mechanism will have
problems. As I don't know somebody who requires it and I don't
have a request for it I would suggest to remove it from the repo.
If it is required I would like to ask you to fix the linuxrc
in order to work with all of our iso types

Please let me know what you think

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
