<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I wanted to ask if kiwi is the official build script being used to create
</I>&gt;<i> the SUSE official live DVDs. 
</I>
yes

&gt;<i> Also I was reading over the kiwi source code
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't understand how the initrd for the live images is created and how
</I>&gt;<i> it works. In one hand I see that there is a linuxrc script in one of the
</I>&gt;<i> directories. But yet  if kiwi is the official tool to create the SUSE live
</I>&gt;<i> DVDs the SUSE live DVDs use a normal init process (which appears to be the
</I>&gt;<i> standard procedure for initramfs) not a linuxrc script. Also I see a
</I>&gt;<i> function called setupSUSEInitrd which calls mkinitrd but I don't see any
</I>&gt;<i> calls to it on the modules directory. Well if somebody could please provide
</I>&gt;<i> some clarification around these issues I would appreciate it a lot.
</I>
when building an image with kiwi no matter if this is a live CD or
a virtual disk, or an USB stick, etc... the first boot is controlled
via kiwi's own boot code. That's what you saw as the linuxrc script.
Each image type has a slightly different way of booting so there is
a linuxrc script for each type. All of these scripts shares the common
code in a collection of functions to prevent duplicating code. That's
the file in which you found among others the setupSUSEInitrd function

The function setupSUSEInitrd normally replaces the kiwi boot code
with the official supported distro boot code so that after first boot
everything is in the same shape as if you would have installed the
system &quot;normally&quot;

In case of a live system things are different. There is no persistent
storage, thus it doesn't make sense to call setupSUSEInitrd because it
can't be stored on your CD/DVD.

The kiwi boot code works similar to the standard boot code at the
end if everything has been set up init is called and the standard
boot process until the login appears happens. There is no difference
to a standard boot after init has been called. Only the code inside
the initrd is different if you compare it with the &quot;normal&quot; yast
driven installation process (which you can't compare in case of a live
system because that is something only kiwi can do for SuSE at
the moment)  

Does this answer some of your questions ?

Regards,
Marcus
