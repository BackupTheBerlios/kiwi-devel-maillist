<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The service/channel setup is implemented for all available package
</I>&gt;<i> managers. So at that point there would be no work. If this would be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented one needs to add a function which is able to read the local
</I>&gt;<i> status of the repositories and this needs to be done for smart and zypper
</I>&gt;<i> as well. I would say it's not that hard to implement but:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I'm a bit in a conflict whether it's a good idea or not. With the
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml my intention among other things was to provide a clean
</I>&gt;<i> description of an operating system. This includes that the package/pattern
</I>&gt;<i> list must correspond with the given repositories. If we allow to have
</I>&gt;<i> something like
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;use the local repos&quot; then we will lose this and an image description
</I>&gt;<i> which works on Bobs maschine because of his custom repo setup may not work
</I>&gt;<i> on Alice maschine because she has a complete different local repo setup.
</I>&gt;<i> And if something is missing on Alice machine who tells her what is missing,
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml doesn't help her in that case
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that you shall have that problem in any case, because you don't send 
the repositories over with the config.xml

Like me, I have local repositories (I don't use the internet ones). So thats 
defined in my config.xml with some local packages that I also use, (changed 
kernels) if I just send the config.xml to someone else it wont work :)

&gt;<i> Well, as an option it would be ok but I think it could introduce multiple
</I>&gt;<i> problems which highly depends on the machines setup. That's something I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to avoid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree on that.

&gt;<i> Just my two cent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Marcus

A world with only one operating system, is a world without choice.
