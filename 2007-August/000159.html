* The service/channel setup is implemented for all available package managers.
  So at that point there would be no work. If this would be implemented one
  needs to add a function which is able to read the local status of the
  repositories and this needs to be done for smart and zypper as well.
  I would say it's not that hard to implement but:

* I'm a bit in a conflict whether it's a good idea or not. With the config.xml
  my intention among other things was to provide a clean description of an
  operating system. This includes that the package/pattern list must correspond
  with the given repositories. If we allow to have something like
  &quot;use the local repos&quot; then we will lose this and an image description which
  works on Bobs maschine because of his custom repo setup may not work on
  Alice maschine because she has a complete different local repo setup.
  And if something is missing on Alice machine who tells her what is
  missing, config.xml doesn't help her in that case

Well, as an option it would be ok but I think it could introduce multiple
problems which highly depends on the machines setup. That's something I
would like to avoid.

Just my two cent

Marcus
