<PRE>
ok here we go.  I have a message waiting in queue to be approved, too big it says.  however, sitting here thought I would try something, I manually installed that atftp rpm then commented it out in the config file.  I also searched the two openSUSE sites and couldn't find that file on them so maybe that is why it failed before, any ways, installed the RPM, reran the script and got to + kiwi create /tmp/kiwi-netboot &gt; /srv/tftpboot/boot  : file not found or some such..  so I deleted the dirs again, and manually created the /srv/tftpboot dir and it's sub boot/  ..  reran the script and it got all the way through except I saw one troubling line  here it is:


+ echo 'NFSROOT=192.168.0.254;/srv/kiwi-ltsp'


/usr/share/kiwi/image/kwltsp-suse-10.2/setup-ltsp.sh: line 34: /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/config.default: No such file or directory


+ echo 'Change the server IP in /srv/kiwi-ltsp/etc/hosts file, leave the server'\''s hostname as it is there'
Change the server IP in /srv/kiwi-ltsp/etc/hosts file, leave the server's hostname as it is there
+ echo 'Please recheck your tftp, nfsserver and dhcpd configurations'
Please recheck your tftp, nfsserver and dhcpd configurations
+ echo 'Set up complete'
Set up complete


It looks like it is having an issue creating the tftp dir under /srv  and also its subs...

Any ideas and where should I go from here..  (BTW  I run my .sh commands with sh -x ./&lt;shellscript&gt;, hence all the captured *echo* commands and the like...)

Making Progress

I had this kind of problems as well. Make a copy of the dvd to /srv/install or 
something and try again/
