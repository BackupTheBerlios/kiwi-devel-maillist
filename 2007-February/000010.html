<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I saw that kiwi currently supports cramfs, but not squashfs.  Is cramfs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preferred?  Everything I've read indicates that squashfs is superior,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I may not have the whole story.  If there are no objections, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take a stab at adding squashfs support.  Using it in our 128M (or larger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ones too) should really help I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I got enough of this completed this weekend that I was able to create a
</I>&gt;<i> squashfs image of wyseGhost-suse-10.2.  The original ext2 image is 461M
</I>&gt;<i> and the squashfs one is 160M.  I'd say that's a pretty significant
</I>&gt;<i> improvement.  Of course, in order for squashfs to be usable for this
</I>&gt;<i> particular case, we'd have to use unionfs (or something) to give us some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of write support.  I don't know how well that works, and it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like a lot of work.  Anyone have experience with that sort of thing?
</I>
The main problem in using a compressed filesystem is that they are
only available as read-only storage. Because of this there are in
principal two possible solutions concerning images:

	1) make use of unionfs to combine read-only and read-write parts
	2) support splited root filesystems

kiwi supports the second variant because as far as I know unionfs
is not part of the standard kernel and has several smaller problems
you need to workaround first. Creating a split image means kiwi will
automatically divide the root system into two parts in the same
way as it does for live systems. The directories /bin /boot /lib /opt /sbin
and /usr will build the read-only part and the rest builds the read-write part.
The nice thing here is that you can specify the filesystem you want
to use for each part. That's the way how I've started to support compressed
filesystems. I have tested such a setup with a small image on a cramfs+ext2
but any other combination is possible as soon as the standard kernel
includes support for it.

The corresponding code which has to combine both filesystems into one
root tree and boot that tree is implemented in the suse-linuxrc of
the netboot boot images. A special setup for the config.&lt;MAC&gt; is needed
to setup the image as so called COMBINED_IMAGE:

for example:
	cat config.00:11:11:09:FB:0E  # my system

	IMAGE=/dev/sda2;minimal-10.1.i686;1.1.2;192.168.100.2;4096,/dev/sda3;minimal-10.1-read-only.i686;1.1.2;192.168.100.2;4096
	PART=200;S;x,500;L;/,x;L;   # swap + sda2(rw) + sda3(ro)
	DISK=/dev/sda
	COMBINED_IMAGE=yes

The disadvantage is that in any case you need to provide a special
linuxrc which is able to boot a splited root system. The current standard
linuxrc doesn't support that which on the other means you need the kiwi
boot mechanism to boot the system... don't know if that is a real problem

Just my thoughts

Regards,
Marcus
