sshd needs to be running so you can access the running instance. 
However, this has nothing to do with the host key.

The errors with the ami-tools is a known bug: 721507

 &gt; ec2:failed to retrieve ec2-ami-tools from S3

&gt;<i> ec2:unable to update ec2-ami-tools
</I>
I've had not time to poke this yet, but Chris is now looking after the 
problem and it should get addressed soon.

 &gt; ec2:failed
ec2:BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS

&gt;<i> ec2:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub: no such file or directory
</I> &gt; ec2:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub:no such file or directory

&gt;<i> ec2:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub: no such file or directory
</I>
Host key generation, i.e. a key-pair by which the machine is identified, 
and not the user, usually happens on firstboot/installation. When you 
install a system from scratch, at the end you'll will see a message and 
get a graphical representation of the host key. This mechanism is, in 
general, independent of KIWI.

There are some potrential culprits at play. Your host key is not getting 
generated because

- of recent changes in the suse-ami-tools package
- you may be leaving out some basic package in config.xml
- you have customized/overwritten scripts that usually generate the host 
key.

Sorry, but I forgot were exactly the host key gets generated. It is 
probably easiest to work backwards from your setup and look at all the 
files you have in your overlay tree.

For information on host key generation see the following:

<A HREF="http://www.geekride.com/how-to-generate-ssh-host-keys/">http://www.geekride.com/how-to-generate-ssh-host-keys/</A>

You can also add a work around into /etc/init.d/boot.local, check the 
presence of the host key, and if it does not exist create one. However, 
that the host keys are missing indicates an underlying issue and the 
boot.local hack is only a dirty work around.

HTH,
Robert
