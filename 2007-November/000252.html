<PRE>Hi All,

v1.85 is building. The following is a list of bugfixes and
enhancements. With the latest release we have two enhancements.
One is based on the new split system by James Willcox, the other
one is the possibility to have your complete image under version
from the first deployment on.

Bugzilla:
=========
   - check result of copying root/ data to image (#339814)
   - added read-only check for mounting the repositories. If a
     repository path has no write permissions it doesn't make sense to
     use aufs/unionfs to implement a read-only mount. Use bind mount
     directly in that situation (#339503)
   - fixed killing dhcpcd if no system update is required (#339460)
   - fixed fstab setup, overwritten due to wrong IO redirection (#339458)
   - added startShell and killShell function to KIWILinuxRC.sh (#335678)
   - added netboot/suse-11.0 target and fix diskless profile (#332595)
   - fixed use of uninitialized value in KIWIURL.pm:87 (#339117)
   - fixed packagemanager adaption if system image and boot image
     description doesn't use the same packagemanager (#338378)
   - added option --bootcd which allows to create a bootable CD
     based on the given initrd file (#338467)

Enhancements:
=============
   - added baseSetupInPlaceGITRepository() function
     With this function you can create a git repository for the root
     filesystem of your image. I'm using this feature for my servers
     at home. In many cases one installs a system and needs to
     configure or install additional stuff afterwards. Sometimes it's
     hard to see the differences during the live time of such a system.
     With the repository in place your root filesystem acts like a checkout
     and you can do all version, dif, branch stuff you like on your
     operating system. Of course in case of binary changes like you have
     installed new software you only will recognize that there is new
     software installed after initial deployment, but this information
     is also valuable and with the new /etc/ImagePackages in place you
     also can check if this new software is part of an add-on package
     or if it is something installed/compiled manually

   - optional split section added by James Willcox &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">james at ximian.com</A>&gt;
     The following applies to the new split image type:
     ---snip---
     In the new split image type, files/directories can exist in one
     of three places: 
  
        1) read-only disk area
        2) read-write disk area
        3) tmpfs
    
     By default, every directory is in tmpfs and every file is a symbolic
     link to the read-only location.  The patch I have attached allows you to
     specify which files/directories should be in one of the two other 
     locations.  For instance, take the following:
  
     &lt;split&gt;
           &lt;temporary&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/fstab&quot;/&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/mtab&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;/temporary&gt;
           &lt;persistent&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/boot&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;/persistent&gt;
     &lt;/split&gt;

     This would copy /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab to tmpfs and put /boot in the
     read-write disk area.  Note, however, that none of the files
     *within* /boot are affected.  They remain symbolic links to the real
     files in the read-only area.  The main advantage to putting just a
     directory in the read-write area is that any new files created there are
     stored on the disk instead of tmpfs.  Of course files can be specified
     here too, and wildcards are allowed.  Example:

     &lt;split&gt;
           &lt;temporary&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/fstab&quot;/&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/mtab&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;/temporary&gt;
           &lt;persistent&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/boot&quot;/&gt;
                  &lt;file name=&quot;/boot/*&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;/persistent&gt;
     &lt;/split&gt;

     This time, all files and directories within /boot are copied to the
     read-write disk image as well.

     The 'split' information is optional.  When left out, no read-write disk
     image is produced since everything is either read-only or on tmpfs in
     that case.
     ---snap---

Other Bugfixes:
===============
   - changed arch call to uname -m to prevent requirement on
     util-linux package
   - fixed oemboot missing md5 file problem
   - cleaned KIWILinuxRC.sh code according to shell syntax
   - added /etc/ImagePackages file on initial deployment
     This is the information of rpm -qa --last
   - added hwinfo to be part of the usbboot boot images
   - added integrity check for --force-new-root option

* Thanks for all your testings and ideas and a special thanks to all
  code contributors. The system starts to become more and more stable
  and I like the ltsp setup ;)

* We still have some problems with small systems especially in case
  of less RAM (means less than 128MB). This is not only kiwi which needs
  to improve but also the base tree's of a SUSE Linux operating system.
  Improvement at that level means to be able to provide minimal
  functionality in a little amount of disk space and to be able to
  enhance the functionality by installing more packages. The package
  structure of SUSE packages is good but the packages are big and
  have a lot of requirements. I'm not sure whether the Awareness for
  small systems will grow but I think we are on the right track.

Have Fun :)

Best Regards,
Marcus
