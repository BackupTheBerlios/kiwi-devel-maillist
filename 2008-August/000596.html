+\chapter{System to image migration}
+\label{chapter:migration}
+\minitoc
+
+KIWI provides an experimental module which allows you to turn your
+running system into an image description. This migration allows you
+to clone your currently running system into an image. The process
+has the following limitations at the moment:
+
+\begin{itemize}
+\item Works for SUSE systems only
+\item You can't rely on the result to be a 100\% ready to use copy
+      of your system. This means some manual postprocessing might
+      be necessary
+\end{itemize}
+
+When calling KIWI's migrate mode it will try to find the base version
+of your operating system and assigns a predefined repository to recreate
+the data which exists in terms of packages. The code inspect your
+system and creates a list of packages and patterns which represents
+your system so far. Of course there are normally some data which
+doesn't belong to any package. These are your configurations your user
+data and all other stuff. KIWI collects all this information and would
+copy it as overlay files as part of the image description. The process
+will skip all remote mounted filesystems and concentrate only on local
+filesystems.
+
+\section{Create a migration report first}
+When running the migration for the first time I
+recommend to create a report first:
+
+\begin{Command}{12cm}
+\begin{verbatim}
+kiwi --migrate mySys --destdir /tmp/migrated \
+     --report
+\end{verbatim}
+\end{Command}
+
+After that call you should walk through the following check list
+
+\begin{itemize}
+\item check the contents of the config.sh script. The migration
+      added at least the services your system runs and adds them
+      to the configuration script. Check this service list
+\item check the report file contents. All data which doesn't belong
+      to a package are listed there. You should make sure whether you
+      need them all or if you could exclude some of them. As a
+      recommendation, you should have as little as possible overlay
+      files.
+\item check the created config.xml image description file. You should
+      at least make sure if the repository is correct and if you need
+      more repositories for packages which are not part of the base
+      repository for example
+\item check the kiwi output on the console. Each package which it can't
+      find in the base repository of the distribution is skipped and
+      not added as package in your package list. So for example if you
+      use the nvidia binary driver package from an extra repo you need
+      to add the repo and the package later in your config.xml file
+\end{itemize}
+
+\section{Migrate my system...}
+After the check list you will have a first impression of your system.
+What data is there what's not part of packages what doesn't need to
+be part of the image description and so on. You can exclude the
+directories which you don't need according to the report file with
+the \verb+--+exclude parameter. Now you can call migrate again and let
+it copy the overlay files too:
+
+\begin{Command}{12cm}
+\begin{verbatim}
+rm -rf /tmp/migrated
+kiwi --migrate mySys --destdir /tmp/migrated \
+     --exclude directory --exclude ... \
+     --add-repo URI --add-repotype type ...
+\end{verbatim}
+\end{Command}
+
+\section{Turn my system into an image...}
+After the process has finished you should check the size of the
+image description. The description itself shouldn't be that big.
+The size of a migrated image description mainly depends on how many
+overlay files exists in the root/ directory. You should really make
+sure whether you need them all or not. Now let's try to create a
+clone image from the description. The most appropriate image type
+to do this is the virtual disk image (vmx)
+
+\begin{Command}{12cm}
+\begin{verbatim}
+kiwi -p /tmp/migrated --root /tmp/mySys
+kiwi --create /tmp/mySys -d /tmp/myResult \
+     --type vmx
+\end{verbatim}
+\end{Command}
+
+If everything worked well you can test the created virtual disk
+image in any full virtual operating system environment like QEMU or
+VMware. Once created the image description can serve for all image
+types kiwi supports.
