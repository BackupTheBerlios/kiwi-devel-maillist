<PRE>Hello Andreas,

&gt;<i> Have no read anything why you called it Kiwi in first place? Can you
</I>&gt;<i> explain? BTW &quot;Kiwi&quot; denominates actually a flightless bird and a
</I>&gt;<i> nickname for New Zealanders. &quot;Kiwi&quot; as a fruit is  called Kiwi fruit
</I>&gt;<i> down here and not KIWI. So when you say fruit lover, that is from a New
</I>&gt;<i> Zealand perspective (where the term originated) not entirely correct ;)
</I>
*hui* I was just waiting for that question :) Ok, it starts at home
when I was hacking the first version of what you know as kiwi. At that
time it didn't had a name and my wife was asking why I'm still working
on something... I said it's not something it could be cool stuff but
I didn't have a name for it. So I asked her what do you think ? Well
she was reading in a nature magazine (nabu) and because she didn't
know as well and I think she wasn't really interested in all that
boring programming stuff :) she just picked up the name of the bird
the magazin reports about. So the name &quot;kiwi&quot; was born. As you may know
the kiwi needs to be protected there aren't much of them and because
this destiny applied to a former project with a similar background I
kept the name.

But as the user base for kiwi grows almost all people didn't thought
of the bird but of the fruit. I wasn't aware that the fruit is named
&quot;Kiwi fruit&quot; thanks for explaining it to me. I think it was Guy Lunardi
who first used the notion of the &quot;Fruit lovers&quot; and I thought *wow*
that's a perfect name for the image building comunity. It's sweet, healthy
and tastes good :-)) I like it

I'm hoping the New Zealanders will forgive me when I didn't used
the term entirely correctly ;)

Best Regards,
Marcus
