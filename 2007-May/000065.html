<PRE>Hi Folks,

today I submitted v1.31 to the build service. There are a few
things which may be important for you:

1) fixed option -c / -C clash
   some of you stumbled over a problem when calling -c instead of
   --create. Well me stupid guy introduced that bug which is an
   option clash to -C. Sorry for any inconvenience

2) experimental &quot;--create-instsource &lt;path&gt;&quot; option
   the config.xml can include information for creating an
   installation source. The section could look like the following
   example:

   &lt;instsource&gt;
      &lt;metadata type=&quot;yast2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source path=&quot;/mounts/source/consistent/full-i386&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/metadata&gt;
      &lt;package name=&quot;inst-meta&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/instsource&gt;

   The goal is to use meta packages which provides information
   and the basic structure of a repository. The repository should
   serve as installation source for creating images. Right now this
   is highly experimental and unfinished. At the time it only downloads
   the packages below the given path. It's problematic to handle
   this distribution independent so there is a lot of work to do.
   If you have ideas or different opinion do not hesitate to share
   your thoughts :)

3) added maintenance chapter to kiwi documentation
   Along with image building it is also very important to think
   about image maintenance. I have created a chapter about how I think
   image maintenance can be done and how kiwi could support this
   process. It would be great to read your comments on that issue.

4) added --add-repo and --add-repotype option to kiwi
   This allows you to specify an additional repository used within
   a prepare or upgrade process. The information will not be written
   to the config.xml file.

5) added inherit attribute to KIWIScheme.xsd
   By setting up the image with the following attribute one can
   inherit the &lt;package&gt; information from another image description.

   &lt;image name=&quot;liveDVD-suse-10.3&quot; inherit=&quot;/tmp/liveDVD-base&quot;&gt;
       ...
   &lt;/image&gt;

6) So short
   * fixed --list option, method listImage()
   * fixed pattern support for -32bit patterns. Patterns are usable
     on x86_64 architectures as well now

7) Last but not least :-)
   There is a potential risk in kiwi which could leave the prepared
   physical extend in a state where removing the extend would remove
   data from your base operating system. How could this happen. For
   example a user killed the kiwi --prepare process with SIGKILL.
   In this case the application has no chance to call the clean up 
   code. If this kill happened after the setupMount() method it will
   leave the prepared tree with a directory named base-system/
   below this path kiwi handles the access into the base system
   which is needed if the repository is a local path outside of
   the chroot environment. Unfortunately it is not possible to mount
   a filesystem twice with different mount options which means 
   I can't mount it read-only if it was mounted read-write. A first
   step in the right direction is to bind mount only the repository
   location and only if these locations are on the local system.
   This has been done in 1.31 version of kiwi. But there is still
   the risk that someone could accidently remove the repository
   which is not good but better than removing the system.
     
   For the future I plan to use unionfs or aufs to be able to mount
   the filesystems read-only. I already proved that and it would
   work. Unfortunately unionfs or aufs doesn't exist everywhere and
   so I can't rely on its existence.

Have fun :)

Best Regards,
Marcus
