<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> The attached patch also fixes an undefined variable access issue, and a
</I>&gt;<i> build error triggered by the xen-guest example. The error condition is
</I>&gt;<i> triggered when specifying a &lt;preferences&gt; section without a &lt;type&gt; as
</I>&gt;<i> the first &lt;preferences&gt; in the config.xml file. The root cause is the
</I>&gt;<i> special treatment of boot image descriptions. When we're done with the
</I>&gt;<i> XML restructuring this type of special casing should no longer be needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last but not least I think there is an issue with the split image. On
</I>&gt;<i> testing the kernel could not be found after image dump when building the
</I>&gt;<i> oem-preload example. However, I feel confident that this was not broken
</I>&gt;<i> by my patch (I tested the preload example with basically the same
</I>&gt;<i> version of the patch prior to pushing the patch to the latest master
</I>&gt;<i> tree and the example worked). I'd appreciate it if this patch could be
</I>&gt;<i> applied prior to the fix for the OEM issue to avoid me having to push
</I>&gt;<i> the patch forward once again due to merge issues.
</I>
I was able to build the suse-11.3/suse-oem-preload example with some
parts of the patch you attached. Using all of the patch makes it fail
I didn't took a closer look why because I had a few concerns while
reading the patch before. Here are the good news first:

* I added the uninitialized value patch in a single commit
* I added __checkTypeUnique in a single commit

The rest is only added in parts and I also added some additions.
I'm still concerned about the setCurrentBuildInfo() change and I
also did not understand why it's required to do it that way. Don't
get me wrong I'm fine having accessor methods and a XML object
which doesn't have a method changing the data set.

According to that I added your KIWIXML changes but not the change
in kiwi.pl and also modified the KIWIXML change to what I think
we want to achieve. Here are the details:

I restructured the XML data processing by adding the following
KIWIXML methods:

   __populateTypeInfo() and
   __populateImageTypeAndNode()

The first method creates the %typeInfo hash which contains all
possible &lt;type&gt; elements according to the selected profiles.

The second method operates on the %typeInfo hash and initializes
those part of the hash which represents the requested image type
or the primary type or the first type read in.

* Both methodes are called only _once_ inside the object constructor
* The existing method getImageTypeAndAttributes() has changed to
  simply return the selected part of the %typeInfo hash and does
  NOT change any object data as done before.

Therefore I think the XML object creation is sane now and we
can focus on writing the accessor functions which imho also belongs
to KIWIXML

I pushed the change recently please review and let me know if
that's apart your ideas and coding

Thanks a lot

Regards,
Marcus
