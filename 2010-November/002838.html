<PRE>Hi,

As Marcus already knows I am working on a major upheaval of the way the
XML data is represented in the code. The over arching theme of this
re-structuring is to remove all knowledge of state out of the KIWIXML
object and have state information stored in a kiwi build manager (this
is currently main::).

I have the implementation basically done but the code changes have
effected many parts of the code and the patch is rather large making
integration and testing in the main trunk rather difficult. However, now
that I am pretty much done with the work I finally figured out a
reasonable way to break the work into smaller more managable parts.

Therefore, I will submit a number of patches over the next few days that
get us closer to the goal of having no state in the XML representation.
This first set of patches does not yet get us to the ultimate goal but
it is a big step in that direction. Also some of the patches will add
code that will not immediately be used. However, since I already have
the complete implementation everything will be used in the end. So
please bear with me if I am adding some &quot;dead code&quot;, it's really more
&quot;not yet alive code&quot;.

The first patch attached here adds a number of consistency checks and
fixes a couple of existing checks. In detail:

1.) only 1 profile may be marked as default via import=&quot;true&quot;
    If multiple import=&quot;true&quot; profiles are allowed we get into a weird
    state where the build type cannot be determined. For example:
    &lt;profiles&gt;
	&lt;profile name=&quot;editor&quot; description=&quot;Editor&quot; import=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;profile name=&quot;office&quot; description=&quot;Office&quot; import=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/profiles&gt;

    &lt;preferences profiles=&quot;editor&quot;&gt;
       &lt;type image=&quot;oem&quot; primary=&quot;true&quot;...../&gt;
       .....
    &lt;/preferences&gt;

    &lt;preferences profiles=&quot;office&quot;&gt;
       &lt;type image=&quot;vmx&quot; primary=&quot;true&quot;...../&gt;
       .....
    &lt;/preferences&gt;
    Leads to undetermined build behavior if no command line argument is
    given as by specification it is not determined whether the oem or
    vmx image should be built.

2.) only 1 type per &lt;preference&gt; spec may be set as default via
    primary=&quot;true&quot;
    This should be fairly obvious, we can only have one default build
    image type.
3.) only 1 &lt;preference&gt; spec may reference 1 &lt;profile&gt;
    This is necessary to avoid the build ambiguity outlined under 1
4.) only 1 &lt;preference&gt; specification without a profiles=&quot;&quot; attribute
    Again, build ambiguity related. Further the configuration in an
    unmarked, i.e. without profiles=&quot;&quot;, &lt;preference&gt; section can be
    considered as the default configuration thus there should only be
    one.
5.) check that all references used via profiles=&quot;aName&quot; attribute have
    a definition of &lt;profile name=&quot;aName&quot;.../&gt;

Additional changes:
- added some comments to indicate which methods are targeted for
  initial removal
- enabled warnings
  ~ fixed a number of &quot;use of uninitialized...&quot; warnings
  ~ one type usage warning that I do not understand; line 2739
    Perl complains despite explicit type conversion????
- moved consistency checking from end of constructor to right after
  syntactic and structure validation of XML, facilitate earlier exit
  and avoid potential problems in object data population
- modified the version check to work of the DOM rather than member
  values set on the XML object
- added pxe to types that must have the filesystem attribute
- modify the postDumpAction check to account for multiple oemconfig
  sections
- renamed the version format check and included check to ensure there is
  only one version definition

Enjoy,
Robert
