<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> This patch lays the ground work for the removal of
</I>&gt;<i> getImageTypeAndAttributes. I am adding a new data structure in KIWIXML
</I>&gt;<i> (details below) and new accessor code. A good chunk of this falls into
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;not yet alive category&quot;.
</I>
Problem with the patch is that it doesn't apply to the current master
branch. Most probably due to the cache and profile fixes I made yesterday
when I was in Nuremberg. Sorry for that

Another thing I found while reading the patch was that I don't understand
why you want to change the hash returned by the former
getImageTypeAndAttributes() into a set of accessor functions.
Personally I liked to have a function returning a hash where I
can operate on and I know that this hash will also change quite often
in the future. So if we need to add/remove an accessor function for
each element of the hash it would make the coding not easier and
maintenance is a nightmare

So what's wrong with:

   $xml -&gt; setCurrentBuildInfo();
   my %build_info = $xml -&gt; getBuildInfo();

   ===&gt; access $build_info{...}

   instead of calling a member function for each item in the hash

I know and I also agree that in strong typed languages accessor functions
for private object data is a good thing but that accessor methods are also
allowed to return more than one element so I think we can live with one
accessor method called getBuildInfo()
(or use the old name getImageTypeAndAttributes() which I would prefer)

It should return the same record than getImageTypeAndAttributes() does
before. That also means we don't have to change the entire code which
accesses what getImageTypeAndAttributes() returned.

The separation into setCurrentBuildInfo and it's accessor
method is great though

&gt;<i> Also included is a minor change to the schema.
</I>
I added that one

Regards,
Marcus
