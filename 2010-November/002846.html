<PRE>Hi,

Yes, I just saw that patch :(
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing I found while reading the patch was that I don't understand
</I>&gt;<i> why you want to change the hash returned by the former
</I>&gt;<i> getImageTypeAndAttributes() into a set of accessor functions.
</I>
The intend is to reduce the coupling of the rest of the code to the data
structure KIWIXML uses to represent the data in config.xml. At present
almost every module needs to have intimate knowledge of how KIWIXML
stores it's data. This very strong coupling is generally not very nice.
Accessors reduce the coupling.

&gt;<i> Personally I liked to have a function returning a hash where I
</I>&gt;<i> can operate on and I know that this hash will also change quite often
</I>&gt;<i> in the future. So if we need to add/remove an accessor function for
</I>&gt;<i> each element of the hash it would make the coding not easier and
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance is a nightmare
</I>
Actually I have found that accessors are a lot easier to maintain. It
might be a bit more typing but from a debugging point of view things are
much easier. More on this below.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what's wrong with:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    $xml -&gt; setCurrentBuildInfo();
</I>&gt;<i>    my %build_info = $xml -&gt; getBuildInfo();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    ===&gt; access $build_info{...}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    instead of calling a member function for each item in the hash
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know and I also agree that in strong typed languages accessor functions
</I>&gt;<i> for private object data is a good thing but that accessor methods are also
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to return more than one element so I think we can live with one
</I>&gt;<i> accessor method called getBuildInfo()
</I>&gt;<i> (or use the old name getImageTypeAndAttributes() which I would prefer)
</I>
But with returning a hash every part of the code that needs to have
information from the configuration must be intimately familiar with the
KIWIXML object data storage model, this is not a good thing. Further
especially in Perl where things get created for you as a &quot;feature&quot; of
the language accessing a hash vs. calling an accessor has terrible
implications.

If something ever gets rename, for whatever reason, it will introduce a
large number of bugs because one can never find all
 ${myHash}{oldName} usages, especially if the old name is something
common. Lets say we wanted to change:

$record{type}          = $node -&gt; getAttribute(&quot;image&quot;);

in getImageTypeAndAttributes to

$record{image}          = $node -&gt; getAttribute(&quot;image&quot;);

to more closely reflect the name used in the XML. This is almost
impossible. Because Perl in general will not complain when you now use

%type = $xml -&gt; getImageTypeAndAttributes();
my $imgT = $type{type}

when it should really be
my $imgT = $type{image}

after the rename. But if I have an accessor all I have to do is change
one place and I know I didn't break anything. Same situation applies if
something gets removed. Once I remove the accessor Perl will nicely
point me to all the places where I am calling the accessor, thus I know
exactly where I have to modify the code. I do not have to run find and
grep and make WAGs (wild ass guesses) where the data might have been used.

So yes, accessors are bit more typing when adding something but they
save days or weeks of debugging time.

Also we already use this model for all the OEM stuff. For the OEM
configuration there's an accessor for every element, rather than one
accessor to get everything in &lt;oemconfig&gt;

Let me know if I convinced you that accessors will make our lives easier
in the future.

Thanks,
Robert
