         different xorg.conf files defined, therefore two distinct groups with one or more hosts
         assigned to each group can now be configured by managing a smaller number of files.&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;/sect2&gt;
+    &lt;sect2&gt;
+      &lt;title&gt; Using Hardware Mapping to Provide Overrides&lt;/title&gt;
+      &lt;para&gt;The only issue with running mixed hardware configurations pertains primarily to hardware
+        differences. For instance, it may be possible to create a single, xorg.conf file that is
+        able to work with all of the hardware, but there is a chance it might not be possible to do
+        so. With this in mind, KIWI provides a mechanism to provide &quot;default&quot; configurations that
+        works with the most common hardware configuration, while providing hardware specific
+        overrides to allow for any differences and yet have all hardware linked to the same
+        group.&lt;/para&gt;
+      &lt;sect3&gt;
+        &lt;title&gt;The Hardware Mapping Elements&lt;/title&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;To make use of the hardware linking mechanism, two additional parameters needs to be
+          added to the group details file, the one named config.&lt;group_name&gt;. These two elements
+          &quot;link&quot; hardware specific configurations to the appropriate systems. A general example
+          would look like this:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;vendor_name_model&quot;
+
+vendor_name_model_HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;00:00:00:11:11:11&quot;&lt;/screen&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;These parameters are not required, and the same functionality can be applied by using
+          multiple groups to do the same thing, but that might not be desirable to some
+          administrators. This feature allows for a slightly more complex group to be defined, but
+          the end result is a single group, that can contain multiple sub-groups ensuring
+          flexibility in using a mixed set of hardware. &lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;The definitions for the above parameters are as follows: &lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;itemizedlist&gt;
+          &lt;listitem&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;HARDWARE_MAP&lt;/para&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;This element follows the same rules as defined by the KIWI_GROUP element. However,
+              this variable will create sub-groups used to ensure multiple types of hardware vendors
+              can be used within the same group.  The name of the group(s) should be clearly
+              defined, and a good convention to follow would be to use a combination of the vendor
+              name with the model number or type. This would allow for cases where the same vendor
+              is used, but differences between alternative models requires different maps to be
+              used.&lt;/para&gt;
+          &lt;/listitem&gt;
+          &lt;listitem&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;&lt;HARDWARE_MAP_NAME&gt;_HARDWARE_MAP&lt;/para&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;This element behaves exactly like the &lt;GROUP_NAME&gt;_KIWI_MAC_LIST element
+              defined above, in that it lists all MAC addreses that need to be linked to a hardware
+              map. Any host defined within the list will receive configuration files that have been
+              specifically defined in a hardware_config.&lt;hardware_map&gt; file, in addition to any
+              files defined within a CONF element.&lt;/para&gt;
+          &lt;/listitem&gt;
+        &lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
+      &lt;/sect3&gt;
+      &lt;sect3&gt;
+        &lt;title&gt;The Hardware Mapping Details File&lt;/title&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;Once the hardware map has been defined, the last step is to ensure configuration
+          specific elements are linked to the host(s) in question. This is done by creating a new
+          hardware_config.&lt;hardware_map&gt; file. The contents of the file is quite simple, and
+          contains only one element called VENDOR_CONF, as the following example shows:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;VENDOR_CONF=CONFIGURATIONS/xorg.conf.hardware_name_model;/etc/X11/xorg.conf;192.168.100.2;4096&lt;/screen&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;The format of the VENDOR_CONF values is exactly the same as the CONF variable used in
+          the standard host and group configurations. In addition, files defined within this list
+          will over-write any files defined in the group configuration, if and only if, all of the
+          following cases apply:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;itemizedlist&gt;
+          &lt;listitem&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;The host is assigned to the current hardware map&lt;/para&gt;
+          &lt;/listitem&gt;
+          &lt;listitem&gt;
+            &lt;para&gt;The file is defined within the CONF and VENDOR_CONF elements&lt;/para&gt;
+          &lt;/listitem&gt;
+        &lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;NOTE: If a file is not defined in the CONF element, but is defined in the VENDOR_CONF
+          element, it is simply downloaded to the host as if it was a CONF file. In this case, no
+          overwritting will take place as it is considered a new file.&lt;/para&gt;
+      &lt;/sect3&gt;
+      &lt;sect3&gt;
+        &lt;title&gt;A Complete Example&lt;/title&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;The following is an example of a group that is using hardware from multiple vendors.
+          For the purposes of this example, lets assume the group will have 10 defined hosts, seven
+          are imaginative HP thinstations, while the remaining three are older Maxterm thinstations.
+          We will also assume that the differences we are trying to address are specific to the
+          video card and X.Org drivers used as a result.&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;With this in mind, we will need the following KIWI specific files:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">root at test01</A> KIWI]# cd /srv/tftpboot/KIWI
+[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">root at test01</A> KIWI]# ls -la

+-rw-r--r--  1 root root  133 Nov  9 04:44 hardware_config.maxterm_3500&lt;/screen&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;As we can see, there is a KIWI group file, the group configuration or details file,
+          and a new file that we have not seen before called hardware_config.maxterm_3500. We will
+          first look at the contents of the config,group file:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">root at test01</A> KIWI]# cat config.group
+KIWI_GROUP=&quot;example1&quot;

+                        00:00:00:00:00:07 00:00:00:00:00:08 00:00:00:00:00:09 00:00:00:00:00:0A&quot;&lt;/screen&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;Within the file, there is a group called &quot;example1&quot;, with ten hosts defined, in this
+          case with imaginary sequential MAC addresses. Next, we look at the config.example1 group
+          details/configuration file:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">root at test01</A> KIWI]# cat config.example1

+        &lt;para&gt;Here, most of the standard KIWI configuration elements are in place, with a few
+          extras. There are three areas we want to focus our attention on, the CONF, HARDWARE_MAP
+          and maxterm_3500_HARDWARE_MAP variables, as they are the most critical elements to our
+          example.&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;The first parameter to look at is the CONF parameter, which indicates a prefs.js (for
+          Mozilla Firefox), and a xorg.conf (for X Windows) files will be copied to the host during
+          boot up. These files should be considered defaults for the group, and all hosts defined in
+          this group will use these files. As such, when the systems boot, both of these files will
+          be copied over to their local file systems when the CONF element is processed.&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;Lastly, we have a hardware mapping group called &quot;maxterm_3500&quot;, with three of the
+          groups hosts defined as part of of a sub-group, or hardware map. The content of this file
+          is as follows:&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;screen&gt;[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">root at test01</A> KIWI]# cat hardware_config.maxterm_3500
+VENDOR_CONF=xorg.conf.maxterm_3500;/etc/X11/xorg.conf;192.168.1.2;4096,someconfig.cfg;/etc/sysconfig/someconfig.cfg;192.168.1.2;4096&lt;/screen&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;When the VENDOR_CONF defintition is used, we are telling KIWI that all files defined
+          within this element, are specific to the hardware map they are linked to. As a result, any
+          files listed here will be transfered to a host if, and only if, the host has been linked
+          to the hardware map via the maxterm_3500_HARDWARE_MAP element. In our example the only
+          systems that will receive the xorg.conf.maxterm_3500 file will be the three maxterms we
+          linked to the hardware map itself.&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;In our VENDOR_CONF element, we are indicating two files that should be transfered, in
+          addition to any file transfered during the processing of the CONF element. A &quot;specific&quot;
+          xorg.conf file, as well as someconfig.cfg. In the case of the xorg.conf.maxterm_3500 file,
+          when it is transfered to the host, it will overwrite the xorg.conf file that was
+          previously transfered via the CONF element. However, with the someconfig.cfg file, because
+          it was not previously defined in the CONF element, it will simply get transfered over, and
+          is a perfect example of how one could enable functionality that is not otherwise
+          configured.&lt;/para&gt;
+        &lt;para&gt;As a result of this example, we have seven terminals that are using a prefs.js and
+          generic xorg.conf file for their system configuration, and three terminals that are using
+          prefs.js, a new version of the xorg.conf file as well as a file called somconfig.cfg. For
+          the purposes of our example, the contents of the prefs.js, xorg.conf,
+          xorg.conf.maxterm_3500 and someconfig.cfg are arbitrary, and don't need to be explained
+          here.&lt;/para&gt;
+      &lt;/sect3&gt;
+    &lt;/sect2&gt;
   &lt;/sect1&gt;
