<PRE>James,

&gt;<i> I admit I wasn't totally sure what $syszip was,
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
&gt;<i> but I don't think I see how
</I>&gt;<i> I broke that.  The patch puts /boot data in the writable area (not squashfs)
</I>&gt;<i> and points grub there.  The big chunk of code that I removed was responsible
</I>&gt;<i> for creating a ext2 filesystem with only /boot, which doesn't appear to be
</I>&gt;<i> needed now at all.  Can you be more specific about what needs changed?
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, when I was using unionfs for my project I did have /boot on the single
</I>&gt;<i> writable partition and things were fine.
</I>
Hmm, now I see the point. you want to remove the boot partition
completely. In principal I don't have any objections but we also
need to change the suse-linuxrc stuff of vmxboot/ and oemboot/ to
be able to work with the new situation. Especially oemboot which
re-partitions the disk is affected here. I'm concerned about this
big change because it could break several projects which rely on
that image type. /boot was assumed to be on the first partition
but after the change it's dynamic. Additionally the location of
the read-only and read-write partition for aufs based images
changes. This also means the handling of UNIONFS_CONFIG in linuxrc
must be changed. Well it really affects more than only the
split part
 
&gt;<i> The thing about having a separate /boot partition is that it totally ruins
</I>&gt;<i> the situation on systems with limited disk space.  Every single megabyte
</I>&gt;<i> matters to me, unfortunately, so having a separate /boot taking away usable
</I>&gt;<i> disk space from the rest of the system really causes problems.
</I>
I agree with that so along with your patch you should also adapt
the linuxrc's of vmxboot and oemboot and we need to test that really
really carefully because the bugs all appear on my side :-)

NOTE:
I'm working on support for cromfs, #379027. The changes I have to
do there affects the code you are about to change too. I think this
will cause merge conflicts. I plan to commit the change tomorrow

Regards,
Marcus
