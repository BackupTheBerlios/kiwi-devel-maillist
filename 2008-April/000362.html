</I>

I admit I wasn't totally sure what $syszip was, but I don't think I see how
I broke that.  The patch puts /boot data in the writable area (not squashfs)
and points grub there.  The big chunk of code that I removed was responsible
for creating a ext2 filesystem with only /boot, which doesn't appear to be
needed now at all.  Can you be more specific about what needs changed?
FWIW, when I was using unionfs for my project I did have /boot on the single
writable partition and things were fine.

The thing about having a separate /boot partition is that it totally ruins
the situation on systems with limited disk space.  Every single megabyte
matters to me, unfortunately, so having a separate /boot taking away usable
disk space from the rest of the system really causes problems.

Thanks,
James
