</I>
Hmm, I didn't think 11.2 is EOL yet. But apparently it is. One can no 
longer build against 11.2 and search is gone as well, as you pointed 
out. Therefore, yes everything in the git tree refering to 11.2 should 
go away, I agree. We just should follow the release cycle here, when a 
distro goes EOL, the examples go away.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Next are the amount of examples in for example
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.4. We have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    examples for each kiwi image type and we also document them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    in the kiwi docs. But we also have additional examples like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    suse-euca-cloud or suse-min-gnome. I'd like to remove them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    here and let them be part of the wiki where we reference
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    them. Robert this is mainly a question for you ? Any objections ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think we want to keep the complete code for these examples
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the wiki. I am actually working on yet another one of these types
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of examples for the OpenNebula infrastructure (which is why other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kiwi work has been taking a back seat lately). I think these are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful and it would be great if we can keep them as part of the Kiwi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> git tree.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The usefulness of these examples certainly goes beyond just the use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Kiwi. These types of examples certainly focus more on appliances
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as a whole, therefore I definitely understand why we would not want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these as part of the core Kiwi git tree, at the moment I think we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lack a better place for these. I am happy to kick some ideas around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if we want to move these out, but just removing them does not work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok, I agree to that. But would you mind if we move those examples
</I>&gt;<i> which are not referenced by the docbook source in the kiwi git into
</I>&gt;<i> an extra directory below examples. I thought like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     kiwi/doc/examples
</I>&gt;<i>     (master*)&gt;  ll
</I>&gt;<i>     total 16K
</I>&gt;<i>           ms suse 2.1K 2011-06-06 14:10 README
</I>&gt;<i>           ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:10 suse-11.3
</I>&gt;<i>           ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:10 suse-11.4
</I>&gt;<i>           ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:11 suse-12.1
</I>&gt;<i>           ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:11 extra
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would affect the euca and min-gnome examples. You should also
</I>&gt;<i> have in mind that 12.1 will have gnome3 and I doubt that the existing
</I>&gt;<i> examples will work with it.
</I>
Yes, I have not looked at GNOME 3 in detail. Quite frankly I am trying 
to ignore the issue for as long as possible and then probably find an 
alternate desktop environment. The live version I tried a few weeks back 
will definitely not work for me. Anyway, that's a tangent.

I agree that the existing example will most likely not work with 12.1 
and GNOME 3. I'm not even sure a min-gnome environment can exist in GNOME 3.

&gt;<i> So it would be good to have the working
</I>&gt;<i> versions as an extra/suse-...
</I>
I am OK with this. Moving all examples that are not referenced in 
docbook and are intended to demonstrate image building and appliances in 
a broader view into extras/suse-...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Next question refers to the enterprise products (SLE). At the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    moment we distinguish between SLES and SLED. I would like to remove
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    SLED as I think it doesn't make sense. System Imaging's target
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    is definitly the server not the desktop. The description itself
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    just differs in terms of repos and packages. Any objections ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I have an issue with this. In the ISV world I live in the SLED
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> templates are definitely useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yep, I got complains from other SUSE groups incl. studio here too :)
</I>&gt;<i> So it has to stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO, as stated above we should keep the &quot;supported&quot; distros until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they reach EOL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we don't have enough manpower on the update and maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> site to achieve this. So 11.3, 11.4 and 12.1 is enough imho, or
</I>&gt;<i> we need more people working on this
</I>
Yes, 11.2 appears to be EOL, therefore we should just have 11.3, 11.4, 
and 12.1


Thanks,
Robert
