<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;* Package kiwi-doc, provides: /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   This directory contains examples for 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and 12.1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Is anybody using these examples ? I'd like to change this to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the last released version. At the moment: '11.4' Any objections ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should keep the examples for all the &quot;supported&quot; versions
</I>&gt;<i> and then remove them as each release of openSUSE reaches EOL. We
</I>&gt;<i> have added a lot of features since Kiwi was released with 11.2 and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore I think many peolpe using Kiwi on 11.2 will want to use
</I>&gt;<i> the development tree. As our feature addition rate slows, a natural
</I>&gt;<i> process, we might want to re-visit this once 11.3 reaches EOL.
</I>
I think not many people use 11.2. Even me who is super slow in
updating the machine is at 11.3. I think it would be enough to
have 11.3 , 11.4 and (12.1). The buildservice package search
engine also does not offer 11.2 anymore.

&gt;<i> &gt;* Next are the amount of examples in for example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.4. We have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   examples for each kiwi image type and we also document them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   in the kiwi docs. But we also have additional examples like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   suse-euca-cloud or suse-min-gnome. I'd like to remove them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   here and let them be part of the wiki where we reference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   them. Robert this is mainly a question for you ? Any objections ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we want to keep the complete code for these examples
</I>&gt;<i> in the wiki. I am actually working on yet another one of these types
</I>&gt;<i> of examples for the OpenNebula infrastructure (which is why other
</I>&gt;<i> Kiwi work has been taking a back seat lately). I think these are
</I>&gt;<i> useful and it would be great if we can keep them as part of the Kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> git tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The usefulness of these examples certainly goes beyond just the use
</I>&gt;<i> of Kiwi. These types of examples certainly focus more on appliances
</I>&gt;<i> as a whole, therefore I definitely understand why we would not want
</I>&gt;<i> these as part of the core Kiwi git tree, at the moment I think we
</I>&gt;<i> lack a better place for these. I am happy to kick some ideas around
</I>&gt;<i> if we want to move these out, but just removing them does not work
</I>&gt;<i> for me.
</I>
ok, I agree to that. But would you mind if we move those examples
which are not referenced by the docbook source in the kiwi git into
an extra directory below examples. I thought like this:

   kiwi/doc/examples
   (master*) &gt; ll
   total 16K
         ms suse 2.1K 2011-06-06 14:10 README
         ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:10 suse-11.3
         ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:10 suse-11.4
         ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:11 suse-12.1
         ms suse 4.0K 2011-06-06 14:11 extra

This would affect the euca and min-gnome examples. You should also
have in mind that 12.1 will have gnome3 and I doubt that the existing
examples will work with it. So it would be good to have the working
versions as an extra/suse-...

&gt;<i> &gt;* Next question refers to the enterprise products (SLE). At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   moment we distinguish between SLES and SLED. I would like to remove
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   SLED as I think it doesn't make sense. System Imaging's target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   is definitly the server not the desktop. The description itself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   just differs in terms of repos and packages. Any objections ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I have an issue with this. In the ISV world I live in the SLED
</I>&gt;<i> templates are definitely useful.
</I>
yep, I got complains from other SUSE groups incl. studio here too :)
So it has to stay.

&gt;<i> IMHO, as stated above we should keep the &quot;supported&quot; distros until
</I>&gt;<i> they reach EOL.
</I>
I think we don't have enough manpower on the update and maintenance
site to achieve this. So 11.3, 11.4 and 12.1 is enough imho, or
we need more people working on this

Regards,
Marcus
