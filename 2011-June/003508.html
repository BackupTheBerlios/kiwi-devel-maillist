I think we should keep the examples for all the &quot;supported&quot; versions and 
then remove them as each release of openSUSE reaches EOL. We have added 
a lot of features since Kiwi was released with 11.2 and therefore I 
think many peolpe using Kiwi on 11.2 will want to use the development 
tree. As our feature addition rate slows, a natural process, we might 
want to re-visit this once 11.3 reaches EOL.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Next are the amount of examples in for example
</I>&gt;<i>    /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.4. We have
</I>&gt;<i>    examples for each kiwi image type and we also document them
</I>&gt;<i>    in the kiwi docs. But we also have additional examples like
</I>&gt;<i>    suse-euca-cloud or suse-min-gnome. I'd like to remove them
</I>&gt;<i>    here and let them be part of the wiki where we reference
</I>&gt;<i>    them. Robert this is mainly a question for you ? Any objections ?
</I>
I don't think we want to keep the complete code for these examples in 
the wiki. I am actually working on yet another one of these types of 
examples for the OpenNebula infrastructure (which is why other Kiwi work 
has been taking a back seat lately). I think these are useful and it 
would be great if we can keep them as part of the Kiwi git tree.

The usefulness of these examples certainly goes beyond just the use of 
Kiwi. These types of examples certainly focus more on appliances as a 
whole, therefore I definitely understand why we would not want these as 
part of the core Kiwi git tree, at the moment I think we lack a better 
place for these. I am happy to kick some ideas around if we want to move 
these out, but just removing them does not work for me.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Next question refers to the enterprise products (SLE). At the
</I>&gt;<i>    moment we distinguish between SLES and SLED. I would like to remove
</I>&gt;<i>    SLED as I think it doesn't make sense. System Imaging's target
</I>&gt;<i>    is definitly the server not the desktop. The description itself
</I>&gt;<i>    just differs in terms of repos and packages. Any objections ?
</I>
Yes, I have an issue with this. In the ISV world I live in the SLED 
templates are definitely useful. While the ratio of SLES vs SLED is 
quite high, we do have appliances that need to start with SLED. That 
said I think it would be worth a discussion with PM and others to see if 
we cannot come up with a unified version, i.e. have suse-SLE11 instead 
of suse-SLES11 and suse-SLED11.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Package kiwi-templates, provides JeOS examples for 11.2, 11.3
</I>&gt;<i>    11.4, 12.1 SLE10 and SLE11. I would like to reduce them to
</I>&gt;<i>    SLE10, SLE11 and the two latest released openSUSE versions (11.3, 11.4)
</I>&gt;<i>    at the moment. Any objections ?
</I>
IMHO, as stated above we should keep the &quot;supported&quot; distros until they 
reach EOL.
