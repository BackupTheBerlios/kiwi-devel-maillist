<PRE>Hi,

I've just started working with the Kiwi-LTSP package.
  
My background: Unix developer/admin since 1985, Linux since 1996. 
Installed and tweaked LTSP 4.2 for SuSE 9.3 and 10.1.  Installed LTSP
5.x on Ubuntu.

My goal is to use LTSP 5.x on blades for compute engines.  We've had
good luck with 4.2 in the past, but it's time to move into the modern
times.

My client is a SuSE shop, so the kiwi project is of more interest than
the Ubuntu tree.

I've run into the same problem that Kai Wollweber described on  Jan 2. 
I'm just not sure how to implement his fix.

I found
kiwi-desc-ltsp-0.2-16.2.noarch.rpm
under
<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/cyberorg/openSUSE_10.3/noarch">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/cyberorg/openSUSE_10.3/noarch</A>

But this doesn't seem to be the version Kai used to fix his
installation.

Is there a CVS or SVN site where I can check out scripts, or an archive
site I should be looking at to download the older RPMs?

I'd also like to see a design document for the Kiwi variant of LTSP. 
Once I get Kiwi running, I'll need to add new packages, but I'm not
sure how to go about that.

I'm thinking that the thrust of the Kiwi project is to make an LTSP
distro that's happy with RPMs and Yast/zypper, rather than running
with Debian/Ubuntu and apt.

I'm much more familiar with the 4.2 LTSP than the 5.x series.  My belief
is that once you get into the NFS-mounted LTSP file system, the two
versions are very similar.  

Is there some philosophy difference between 4.2 and 5.x that I should
be aware of?

Thanks for any pointers to info sites, archives, etc.

I'll be happy to report what I did and what worked.

Clif
