<PRE>Hi All,

version v2.23 is building. Between the last announcement of
version v2.13 and this one some important parts has changed.
Before I list the bugfixes and smaller enhancements I would
like to explain the bigger changes first. Ok here we go:

1) Enhanced split image type
   -------------------------
   Some of you know there is a split image type which was used
   by the netboot boot image to allow an image to be splitted
   into two portions and linked together again without using
   overlay filesystems like for example aufs. James Willcox has
   improved my first version of this split type and it works
   pretty well. All implementations of overlay filesystems exising
   today are not accepted by the kernel community as &quot;clean solution&quot;
   they implemented code which normally should go the the vfs layer
   of the kernel. As the virtual filesystem layer is a core component
   it's not easy to get major changes in there. Because of this
   reason I think the split image support would be useful for other
   image types too. This version of kiwi supports split images
   for the following boot types:

		vmxboot
        oemboot
		usbboot
		netboot

   xenboot which is used for Xen _guests_ will not support split.
   I think it doesn't make much sense there and isoboot provides
   with the flags=&quot;compressed&quot; value a split solution which we
   should adapt to the system James used.

   For all split images you need at least the following split
   sections in order to allow people to login to the image due
   to minimum write permissions:

   &lt;split&gt;
        &lt;persistent&gt;
            &lt;file name=&quot;/var&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;file name=&quot;/var/*&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/persistent&gt;
   &lt;/split&gt;

   An example image description using split can be found here
   <A HREF="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/distribution/images/wyseXMini-suse-11.0">https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/distribution/images/wyseXMini-suse-11.0</A> 

2) ISO boot catalog relocation
   ---------------------------
   Some BIOS implementations expect the boot catalog at the
   very first blocks of an ISO image. mkisofs places it somewhere
   more in the back which caused boot problems on &quot;broken&quot; BIOS
   implementations. The ISO doesn't boot in such a situation or
   is not accepted as bootable medium. kiwi now includes 
   a relocation function which moves the boot catalog at the
   first possible place

3) XML schema element order
   ------------------------
   With the latest version I break up the strict ordering of
   XML sections. You are now free to add the sections in the order
   you like

4) No kernel flavor boot image descriptions
   ----------------------------------------
   Some of you might have noticed that there are boot image
   descriptions which are different only in their kernel specifications
   I have removed all of them and handle them now via profiles.
   Each boot image description which supports it can be flavored with
   the xen and smp kernels. The Parameter bootprofile=&quot;...&quot; can be
   set accordingly and normally points to the value &quot;default&quot;
   If you have for example a reference to:

   boot=netboot/suse-10-3-smp

   change it to

   boot=netboot/suse-10.3 bootprofile=&quot;smp&quot;

Ok, so I hope you'll find that changes useful too.
Here is the bug fix list:

Bugzilla:
=========
   - fixed module probing code due to hwinfo changes (bnc #359788)
   - added interactive creation of destination directory (bnc #360487)
   - add ramdisk module (rd) to netboot and load the module (bnc #310001)
   - increase CD/DVD drive test max probe count (bnc #356571)
   - create very first smart cache inside the chroot (bnc #359449)
   - fixed CD/DVD detection (bnc #359511)
   - fixed cleanup function call when <A HREF="iso://">iso://</A> type is used (#356928)
   - fixed usb hub detection (#348362)
   - umount USB stick partitions before deployment (#355938)

Other Bugfixes:
===============
   - make /var/log/boot.kiwi available in system image
   - added tar program to be available in boot images
   - fixed /proc/cmdline processing
   - cleaned up mountSystem function, use sub functions to
     be called according to the different root mount methods
   - fixed grub setup in KIWIBoot.pm if the used kernel is a Xen kernel
   - added better disk detection for oemboot installation mode. We also
     present the user a list of disk devices found and a selection must
     be done at that point
   - fixed missing device nodes in chroot system. When in the
     second stage of the prepare step smart and zypper may require
     access to the /dev device nodes.
   - fixed URL problems if special characters are used. The bash
     we use to add the channels evaluates the data which it shouldn't do
   - add smart channel information to log file
   - don't remove file utility from diskless netboot profile

Thanks for all your valuable input

Have Fun :-)

Best Regards,
Marcus
