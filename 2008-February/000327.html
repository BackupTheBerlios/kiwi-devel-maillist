<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I've attached a patch which changes the 'compressed' Live CD image to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the new-and-improved split image type.  The main benefit of this is that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows greater flexibility at runtime.  Instead of just a few toplevel trees
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being writable, every directory is.  The 'split' node in config.xml can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used to specify which files should be read/write (i.e., on tmpfs instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; squashfs).  You can do this by simply referencing the paths within the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'temporary' section as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;split&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;temporary&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/sysconfig/*&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;/temporary&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/split&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would make all of the files in /etc/sysconfig writable by placing them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in tmpfs instead of the compressed read-only squashfs area.  Anything listed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the 'persistent' section of the 'split' node is automatically merged into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 'temporary' list, since there is no persistent storage in a Live CD.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, this patch also includes my previous patch, since it is dependent on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a big change. I will test it today with the current liveCD
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure there is no breakage. With the old &quot;compressed&quot; style  
</I>&gt;<i> we had /bin /boot /lib /opt /sbin /usr as read-only information
</I>&gt;<i> and the rest was writable. With the new system we define in a split
</I>&gt;<i> section what is writable That's exactly the other way round. Could
</I>&gt;<i> you provide me with a split section you use which has all the
</I>&gt;<i> important writable information in it ? It's because I had to adapt
</I>&gt;<i> the current liveCD description according to the new system and
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to prevent to find out by try and error what would be
</I>&gt;<i> good to become writable
</I>
found a few small problems and fixed them. All iso types works now.
I have committed the patch and submitted new packages to the build
service.

Important information:
======================
Due to this change the kiwi iso type if used in combination with
	
	flags=&quot;compressed&quot;

has changed. The old system uses a fixed set of read-only paths whereas
the rest of the filesystem was used as read-write data. This is rather
inflexible and doesn't allow to specify read-write data on a per file
basis. With the new system the creator of the image description needs
to describe what should be read-write in the ISO. Therefore the 
&lt;split&gt; section must be used. In order to be able to login to a system
at least the /var filesystem must be writable. I found it was a good
thing to have at least the following split section:

  &lt;split&gt;
    &lt;temporary&gt;
      &lt;!-- allow read/write access to: --&gt;
      &lt;file name=&quot;/var&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;file name=&quot;/var/*&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;file name=&quot;/etc&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/*&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/temporary&gt;
  &lt;/split&gt;

This change applies to kiwi version 2.25

Thanks James for your patch

Regards,
Marcus
