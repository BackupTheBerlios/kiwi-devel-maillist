<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I've attached a patch which changes the 'compressed' Live CD image to use
</I>&gt;<i> the new-and-improved split image type.  The main benefit of this is that it
</I>&gt;<i> allows greater flexibility at runtime.  Instead of just a few toplevel trees
</I>&gt;<i> being writable, every directory is.  The 'split' node in config.xml can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to specify which files should be read/write (i.e., on tmpfs instead of
</I>&gt;<i> squashfs).  You can do this by simply referencing the paths within the
</I>&gt;<i> 'temporary' section as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;split&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;temporary&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;file name=&quot;/etc/sysconfig/*&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/temporary&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/split&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would make all of the files in /etc/sysconfig writable by placing them
</I>&gt;<i> in tmpfs instead of the compressed read-only squashfs area.  Anything listed
</I>&gt;<i> in the 'persistent' section of the 'split' node is automatically merged into
</I>&gt;<i> the 'temporary' list, since there is no persistent storage in a Live CD.
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, this patch also includes my previous patch, since it is dependent on
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
This is a big change. I will test it today with the current liveCD
to make sure there is no breakage. With the old &quot;compressed&quot; style  
we had /bin /boot /lib /opt /sbin /usr as read-only information
and the rest was writable. With the new system we define in a split
section what is writable That's exactly the other way round. Could
you provide me with a split section you use which has all the
important writable information in it ? It's because I had to adapt
the current liveCD description according to the new system and
I would like to prevent to find out by try and error what would be
good to become writable

Thanks

PS:
James sorry if I'm not that responsive this week but in Nuremberg
it's hackweek and so the daily business intentionally suffers a bit
 
Regards,
Marcus
