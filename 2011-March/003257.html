</I>
I think the following decision should work (this is for everything 
outside $HOME of a user)

Look at each file from the overlay tree or installed archives, collect 
the users from /etc/passwd in the chroot environment.

For each file from overlay tree and archives, if owner is /etc/passwd 
leave it alone, i.e. assume the person building the image setup 
permissions as desired, if owner not in /etc/passwd change owner ship to 
root:root

I think this would be reasonable.
