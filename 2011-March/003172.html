</I>Great!

&gt;<i> It looks like you have a use case which required this change. Would

</I>Gladly. We use kiwi to produce appliances and desperately wanted a way
to update them without having to replace the boot medium. We switched
to isohybrid images because they are much easier to deploy (cat to
medium without having to worry about kiwi being installed).

The image has to be postprocessed (similar to the things that isohybrid
from isolinux does):

 - replacing the boot code (with a patched version of isolinux
   first stage bootloader, see below)
 - embedding the offset of the bootloader into the mbr
 - setting the disk identifier
 - creating two partitions, making them a bit larger to allow future
   upgrades to grow
 - (optional) creating an additional data partition
 - marking the first partition bootable

The bootloader looks for the first partition marked as active and loads
isolinux.bin from there. The patch against isolinux is attached (it is
rather small and verbosely documented).

Once the image is written to an writable medium, it can be updated like
this (while the system is up and running):

dd if=update.iso of=$DEVICE bs=512 seek=1 skip=1
set_bootable $DEVICE
reboot

with $DEVICE pointing to the partition *not* marked as active. The old
system can be booted by toggling the bootable flags.

Limitations of this approach:
 - the bootloader offset must match
 - the disk identifier must match

One could overcome these limitations by also updating the first 446
bytes of the bootsector (dd if=update.iso of=$WHOLEDISK bs=446 count=1)
at the cost of losing the ability to restore the old system by simply
toggling the bootable flags.

I've reimplemented the functionality isohybrid(,.pl) provides and
extended it to create updatable isohybrid images. If you're interested
in this I'd talk to my employer about releasing it.

I do have a feature request: There is one thing stopping us from
creating updatable isohybrid images with kiwi without remastering them
(or maybe it is already possible?), we need to be able to set the disk
id (called mbrid in KIWIIsoLinux.pm) to a fixed value, preferably in
the image configuration file.

I would send a patch myself but I have little experience with perl and
relaxng and haven't looked too deeply into kiwis code and since the
required change should be rather small once you know where to look I
thought I might just ask ;)

Cheers,
Justus
