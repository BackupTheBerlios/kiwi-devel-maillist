For packages that is correct, ownership and permissions are certainly 
the packages responsibility. However, if a user creates an init script 
in the overlay tree the ownership does not get changed and the create 
image has the ownership for the UID from the build system.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there might also be some bugs in the distribution

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that it's kiwi's task to fix them too
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No definitely not, and I was not trying to imply that. Kiwi just should 
take care of the files that get into the image via archives and the 
overlay tree. Everything else is the responsibility of the packages, no 
question about that.
