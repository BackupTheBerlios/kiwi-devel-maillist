<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> When a user sets up a configuration tree, files and directories
</I>&gt;<i> created in the overlay tree will have the users umask (from the
</I>&gt;<i> build system). When the overlay tree is copied to the unpacked image
</I>&gt;<i> the permissions are preserved. This is most likely not correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering if kiwi should &quot;fix&quot; the permissions for well known
</I>&gt;<i> places. For example things that end up in /etc, /bin, /usr/bin get
</I>&gt;<i> root ownership. If a user is created in config.xml and files are
</I>&gt;<i> pulled in from the overlay tree into the created user's home
</I>&gt;<i> directory we should probably change the ownership such that the
</I>&gt;<i> created user owns the files.
</I>
The ownership of the users created by kiwi is changed to
the users uid and gid. See KIWiConfigure.pm

   $kiwi -&gt; info(&quot;Setting owner/group permissions $user [$group]&quot;);
   $data = qxx ( &quot;chroot $root chown -R $user:$group $home 2&gt;&amp;1&quot; );

if this is not done, it's most probably a bug

&gt;<i> I am sure there are other scenarios, just throwing out a couple of examples.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not alking about fiddling the permission bits, only ownership.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problem today is generally ignored and I doubt that
</I>&gt;<i> people add chown/chgrp commands into config.sh
</I>
I agree it's our job to setup that correctly. But I'm still
under the impression that we do that :) the users ownership is
adapted and everything else belongs to root or is adapted by
the package postscripts which for example creates a new postfix
user and makes sure the ownership is setup correctly

I think there might also be some bugs in the distribution
which prevents the ownership from being set correctly.
I don't think that it's kiwi's task to fix them too

Regards,
Marcus
