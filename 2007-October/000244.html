<PRE>Hi Fruit Lovers :-)

v1.80 is building. We have a again fixed some bugs and this
version also includes a nice patch concerning split images
by James Willcox:

Bugzilla:
=========
   - added support for kiwibrokenmodule kernel parameter. A list
     of comma seperated modules which should _not_ become loaded
     even if they are selected to get loaded (#337545)
   - added support for kiwinoswapsearch kernel parameter. If set
     the isoboot (live systems) boot image will not setup a swap
     space or swap file (#337533)
   - fixed interrupt signal handling (#337009)
   
Enhancements:
=============
   - added new sub-package kiwi-tools which includes a few helper
     tools. At the moment most of them are used internally but we
     can add more if needed.

   - using new split image system by James Willcox &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-devel">james at ximian.com</A>&gt;
     Thanks James, great job !

     ---snip---
     The split image type has changed:
     Given a read-only image, a tarball of directories and symbolic
     links is created which mirrors the structure of the read-only image.
     The symbolic link for each file points to the location where the
     read-only image will be mounted.  For instance, /usr/lib/libfoo.so
     will be a link to /read-only/usr/lib/libfoo.so.  After creating this
     tarball, it is placed in the read-only image at /rootfs.tar.bz2.
     At mount time, this tarball is unpacked into a tmpfs and used as the
     root filesystem.  The advantage of this approach over a typical 'split'
     filesystem is that new files can be created in every directory
     instead of just a few pre-defined toplevel trees.

     This patch also goes one level further and separates some directories
     (/etc, /root, /home, /var/lib/rpm) to be put onto a separate read-write
     image.  The advantage of this is that when deployed onto a diskful
     machine, any files created in those trees will be stored on the disk
     instead of tmpfs.  We may want to have a way for images to specify those
     paths directly instead of having a hard-coded list.

     Secondly, the patch adds a hook mechanism to the netboot script.  With
     this, custom images can get their own script code executed at various
     points.  This is great if, for instance, you need to conditionally load
     kernel modules with specific parameters.  It can be used by simply
     creating a file like /hooks/&lt;hook_name&gt;.sh with the custom bits inside.
     These scripts are sourced from the init script so they have access to
     the same variables/functions.
     ---snap---

     The split system is a nice alternative for the problem of the
     missing or not working aufs/unionfs implementations

Other Bugfixes:
===============
   - added KDE profile to createLiveCD script
   - fixed attribute flags check, check for empty value too
   - added option --prebuiltbootimage which allows to specify another
     than the default search path for the pre-built boot images
   - added option --listxmlinfo which prints information from
     config.xml. Right now this function is used for internal reasons
     only but can be enhanced to print more useful information
   - fixed use of --logfile option

Have Fun :-)

Regards,
Marcus
