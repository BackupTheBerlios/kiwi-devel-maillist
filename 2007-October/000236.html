<PRE>Hi James,

&gt;<i> &gt; yeah a really big patch. I think you had to do all these adaptions because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the aufs problem right ? The problem I see is that this is very special
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the needs of your team and the patch affects many code parts but doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include any documentation which could make it useable by others too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well my team certainly has a need for something like this, you are
</I>&gt;<i> right.  I don't think it is specific to us, though.  IMHO, a solution
</I>&gt;<i> like this is a decent substitution for any of KIWI's typical
</I>&gt;<i> unionfs/aufs usage (LiveCD, etc).
</I>
Ok, that sounds great

&gt;<i> &gt; Sounds like a good approach. Do you think it makes sense to have this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new kind of split systems as an replacement of what I have included into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kiwi ? I think the &quot;split&quot; type is not used at the moment and I think we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't want to maintain two similar systems. What do you think ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally think it should obsolete the other 'split' system, but
</I>&gt;<i> didn't want to do that immediately in case you disliked it for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason. :)
</I>
He He no worries. So let's to that replace my split system with yours.
I think that's great because you really need it and so it gets tested
and works. Would you mind to change your patch so that it replaces my
split with your split ? I can commit the patch immediately after a short
review.

One open issue remains. I think we should tell our people how to make use
of this split system. If you don't have time to integrate that into
the official documentation it would be very good if you could provide
a small README or something which I or some doc people could integrate
later.

What do you think ? 

&gt;<i> &gt; How do you place the hook scripts into the initrd ? Does that happen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manually ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, currently you just put those files into the image yourself using
</I>&gt;<i> the normal mechanisms.
</I>
ok

&gt;<i> &gt; The patch looks good to me. One question about it: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; -	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -b 4096 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -s 513 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a reason for this change ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I had forgotten about that.  I had to remove the -b parameter
</I>&gt;<i> because for very small filesystems mkreiserfs was failing.  I then added
</I>&gt;<i> the -s param to make the journal as small as possible.  I'm not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> we can expose those kind of settings :/
</I>
that's ok let's go for it

Regards,
Marcus
