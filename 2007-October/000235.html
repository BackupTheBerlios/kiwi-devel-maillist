&gt;<i> Hi James,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The attached patch is pretty large (sorry), and couple different things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yeah a really big patch. I think you had to do all these adaptions because
</I>&gt;<i> of the aufs problem right ? The problem I see is that this is very special
</I>&gt;<i> to the needs of your team and the patch affects many code parts but doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> include any documentation which could make it useable by others too.
</I>
Well my team certainly has a need for something like this, you are
right.  I don't think it is specific to us, though.  IMHO, a solution
like this is a decent substitution for any of KIWI's typical
unionfs/aufs usage (LiveCD, etc).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Firstly, it adds a new 'symlink' image type.  This is similar in a way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the 'split' image type, but it is a bit more complicated.  Given a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read-only image, a tarball of directories and symbolic links is created
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which mirrors the structure of the read-only image.  The symbolic link
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for each file points to the location where the read-only image will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mounted.  For instance, /usr/lib/libfoo.so will be a link
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to /read-only/usr/lib/libfoo.so.  After creating this tarball, it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; placed in the read-only image at /rootfs.tar.bz2.  At mount time, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tarball is unpacked into a tmpfs and used as the root filesystem.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advantage of this approach over a typical 'split' filesystem is that new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files can be created in every directory instead of just a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pre-defined toplevel trees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like a good approach. Do you think it makes sense to have this
</I>&gt;<i> new kind of split systems as an replacement of what I have included into
</I>&gt;<i> kiwi ? I think the &quot;split&quot; type is not used at the moment and I think we
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to maintain two similar systems. What do you think ?
</I>
I personally think it should obsolete the other 'split' system, but
didn't want to do that immediately in case you disliked it for some
reason. :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This patch also goes one level further and separates some directories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (/etc, /root, /home, /var/lib/rpm) to be put onto a separate read-write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; image.  The advantage of this is that when deployed onto a diskful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine, any files created in those trees will be stored on the disk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of tmpfs.  We may want to have a way for images to specify those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paths directly instead of having a hard-coded list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Secondly, the patch adds a hook mechanism to the netboot script.  With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this, custom images can get their own script code executed at various
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; points.  This is great if, for instance, you need to conditionally load
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kernel modules with specific parameters.  It can be used by simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating a file like /hooks/&lt;hook_name&gt;.sh with the custom bits inside.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These scripts are sourced from the init script so they have access to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same variables/functions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you place the hook scripts into the initrd ? Does that happen
</I>&gt;<i> manually ?
</I>
Yeah, currently you just put those files into the image yourself using
the normal mechanisms.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The patch looks good to me. One question about it: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -b 4096 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -s 513 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a reason for this change ?
</I>
Ah, I had forgotten about that.  I had to remove the -b parameter
because for very small filesystems mkreiserfs was failing.  I then added
the -s param to make the journal as small as possible.  I'm not sure how
we can expose those kind of settings :/
