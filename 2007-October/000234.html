<PRE>Hi James,

&gt;<i> The attached patch is pretty large (sorry), and couple different things.
</I>
yeah a really big patch. I think you had to do all these adaptions because
of the aufs problem right ? The problem I see is that this is very special
to the needs of your team and the patch affects many code parts but doesn't
include any documentation which could make it useable by others too.

&gt;<i> Firstly, it adds a new 'symlink' image type.  This is similar in a way
</I>&gt;<i> to the 'split' image type, but it is a bit more complicated.  Given a
</I>&gt;<i> read-only image, a tarball of directories and symbolic links is created
</I>&gt;<i> which mirrors the structure of the read-only image.  The symbolic link
</I>&gt;<i> for each file points to the location where the read-only image will be
</I>&gt;<i> mounted.  For instance, /usr/lib/libfoo.so will be a link
</I>&gt;<i> to /read-only/usr/lib/libfoo.so.  After creating this tarball, it is
</I>&gt;<i> placed in the read-only image at /rootfs.tar.bz2.  At mount time, this
</I>&gt;<i> tarball is unpacked into a tmpfs and used as the root filesystem.  The
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of this approach over a typical 'split' filesystem is that new
</I>&gt;<i> files can be created in every directory instead of just a few
</I>&gt;<i> pre-defined toplevel trees.
</I>
Sounds like a good approach. Do you think it makes sense to have this
new kind of split systems as an replacement of what I have included into
kiwi ? I think the &quot;split&quot; type is not used at the moment and I think we
don't want to maintain two similar systems. What do you think ?

&gt;<i> This patch also goes one level further and separates some directories
</I>&gt;<i> (/etc, /root, /home, /var/lib/rpm) to be put onto a separate read-write
</I>&gt;<i> image.  The advantage of this is that when deployed onto a diskful
</I>&gt;<i> machine, any files created in those trees will be stored on the disk
</I>&gt;<i> instead of tmpfs.  We may want to have a way for images to specify those
</I>&gt;<i> paths directly instead of having a hard-coded list.
</I>
I agree

&gt;<i> Secondly, the patch adds a hook mechanism to the netboot script.  With
</I>&gt;<i> this, custom images can get their own script code executed at various
</I>&gt;<i> points.  This is great if, for instance, you need to conditionally load
</I>&gt;<i> kernel modules with specific parameters.  It can be used by simply
</I>&gt;<i> creating a file like /hooks/&lt;hook_name&gt;.sh with the custom bits inside.
</I>&gt;<i> These scripts are sourced from the init script so they have access to
</I>&gt;<i> the same variables/functions.
</I>
How do you place the hook scripts into the initrd ? Does that happen
manually ?

The patch looks good to me. One question about it: 

&gt;<i> -	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -b 4096 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>&gt;<i> +	my $data = qx (/sbin/mkreiserfs -q -f -s 513 $imageDest/$name 2&gt;&amp;1);
</I>
Is there a reason for this change ?

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
