<PRE>

Splashimage option is not available in the upstream grub. It is a custom patch added by RHEL/CentOS.

The splashimage option is used by grub to populate the background of the grub menu with the image provided as input. The kernel/initrd don't play any role  at this time. 


The graphical boot of CentOSx is handled by rhgb (by adding &quot;rhgb&quot; to the kernel options while booting to runlevel 5). This is replaced by Plymouth in RHEL6x, which has more configurable options (like a choice of theme to select). The Plymouth (in rhel6) has a configuration file, but still needs &quot;rhgb&quot; to be added to the kernel options. 


There are no configuration options w.r.t graphical boot while using rhgb. If one has to update anything with rhgb, they have to update the sources of rhgb and re-create the package.


Here is what I am thinking:
i) if a user enters &quot;rhgb&quot; as the boot theme
	a. Add &quot;rhgb&quot; to the kernel boot options
	b. Add &quot;splashimage&quot; line to the menu.lst file
ii) if an user enter &quot;rhgb-somename&quot; as the boot theme
	a. Add &quot;splashimage&quot; line to the menu.lst file. 
	b. Configure Plymouth, with &quot;somename&quot; as the theme.
iii) Any other name, try to configure gfxboot.


Makes sense?

Thank you

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From what I checked, the grub package in CentOS/RHEL distribution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't support the gfxmenu tag. So, the line like &quot;gfxmenu
</I>&gt;<i> (hd0)/message&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will have no effect on the boot loader.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well that explains everything :-) Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to support gfxboot branding on CentOS/RHEL, the grub has to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be re-compiled. I didn't want to do that,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm 100% behind you with this
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I used the built-in features (which is adding the splashimage).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The above patch will only check for the splash image file, only if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gfxboot branding configuration fails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ah, so this is all about splash not graphics boot. Sorry I was confused about
</I>&gt;<i> this, and better should read the patches you sent; splashimage=...
</I>&gt;<i> is pretty obvious isn't it ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The grub package in CentOS requires a package &quot;system-logos&quot;. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redhat-logos package in CentOS provides &quot;system-logos&quot; and resolves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this dependency.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If an user wants to create a custom boot splash, the user will have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create a new package which provides &quot;system-logos&quot; and make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; package is picked up instead of &quot;redhat-logos&quot; package. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direct way to choose a theme from config.xml like in SUSE.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only file that seems to be used by the grub bootloader in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redhat-logos package, is the splash file (/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All the other files are used by various other applications.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unlike the SUSE distribution, the /boot/message file provided by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;redhat-logos&quot; package in CentOS is just an image file in PCX format.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Considering these changes, quite some effort is required to enable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gfxboot branding in the grub package of CentOS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ok that all makes sense now. So in order to integrate that better in kiwi I
</I>&gt;<i> think I should get a better understanding of how the splash works in RHEL. in
</I>&gt;<i> SUSE the splash is just added at the end of the initrd cpio archive. The suse
</I>&gt;<i> kernel has a patch to check for the splash signature at the end of the initrd
</I>&gt;<i> and displays that. I think in RHEL it works differently as the setup of the
</I>&gt;<i> splash is a grub option I'd like to ask is this &quot;splashimage=&quot; an upstream grub
</I>&gt;<i> feature or a RHEL addon ? and the second question is how is the splash PCX
</I>&gt;<i> image activated ? Does this happen as program code inside the initrd or is this
</I>&gt;<i> done by the kernel itself ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any thoughts to handle the bootsplash in CentOS better?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand how it works in RHEL I can think of how to integrate it better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We could leave a comment on kiwi documentation, that gfxboot branding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no supported
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yes that makes sense as well
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...splash and gfxboot, I think each distro does that differently *uff*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the details
