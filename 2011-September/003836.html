<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> From what I checked, the grub package in CentOS/RHEL distribution
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't support the gfxmenu tag. So, the line like &quot;gfxmenu (hd0)/message&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> will have no effect on the boot loader. 
</I>
Well that explains everything :-) Thanks

&gt;<i> In order to support gfxboot branding on CentOS/RHEL, the grub has
</I>&gt;<i> to be re-compiled. I didn't want to do that,
</I>
I'm 100% behind you with this

&gt;<i> so I used the built-in features (which is adding the splashimage).
</I>&gt;<i> The above patch will only check for the splash image file, only if
</I>&gt;<i> the gfxboot branding configuration fails. 
</I>
ah, so this is all about splash not graphics boot. Sorry I was confused
about this, and better should read the patches you sent; splashimage=...
is pretty obvious isn't it ;)

&gt;<i> The grub package in CentOS requires a package &quot;system-logos&quot;. The
</I>&gt;<i> redhat-logos package in CentOS provides &quot;system-logos&quot; and resolves
</I>&gt;<i> this dependency. 
</I>&gt;<i> If an user wants to create a custom boot splash, the user will have to
</I>&gt;<i> create a new package which provides &quot;system-logos&quot; and make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> package is picked up instead of &quot;redhat-logos&quot; package. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> direct way to choose a theme from config.xml like in SUSE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only file that seems to be used by the grub bootloader in the
</I>&gt;<i> redhat-logos package, is the splash file (/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz).
</I>&gt;<i> All the other files are used by various other applications.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike the SUSE distribution, the /boot/message file provided by
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;redhat-logos&quot; package in CentOS is just an image file in PCX format.
</I>&gt;<i> Considering these changes, quite some effort is required to enable
</I>&gt;<i> gfxboot branding in the grub package of CentOS. 
</I>
ok that all makes sense now. So in order to integrate that better in
kiwi I think I should get a better understanding of how the splash
works in RHEL. in SUSE the splash is just added at the end of the
initrd cpio archive. The suse kernel has a patch to check for the splash
signature at the end of the initrd and displays that. I think in
RHEL it works differently as the setup of the splash is a grub option
I'd like to ask is this &quot;splashimage=&quot; an upstream grub feature or
a RHEL addon ? and the second question is how is the splash PCX
image activated ? Does this happen as program code inside the
initrd or is this done by the kernel itself ?

&gt;<i> Any thoughts to handle the bootsplash in CentOS better?
</I>
If I understand how it works in RHEL I can think of how to integrate
it better. 

&gt;<i> We could leave a comment on kiwi documentation, that gfxboot branding
</I>&gt;<i> is no supported 
</I>
yes that makes sense as well

...splash and gfxboot, I think each distro does that differently *uff*

Thanks for the details

Regards,
Marcus
