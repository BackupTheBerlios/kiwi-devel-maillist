<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> This is what I noticed while using the remote repositories for
</I>&gt;<i> boot images(initrd):
</I>
Thanks for the feedback I added Adrian Schr&#246;ter who can tell us more

&gt;<i> While building appliances in OBS using kiwi, an user cannot use http/https repositories. So, the user will have to replace the http repositories (example <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances:/rhel-054/RedHat_RHEL-5">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances:/rhel-054/RedHat_RHEL-5</A>) in the boot configs with the right <A HREF="obs://">obs://</A> repositories.
</I>
I guess there is no other way to reference repositories when using
the image building feature of OBS.

&gt;<i> OBS currently caches all the packages while building the system image. The same cache is made available for kiwi to build the boot images. If a particular package is required by the boot image and not cached already by any dependencies of the system image, the user will have to add that package in the system image configuration and  get the package cached and make it available for the boot image.
</I>
yes this is pretty bad and shouldn't be required because that way you
add packages to the system image which you a) don't need and b) don't want
to have in the RHEL appliance because it might break the integrity of
the system. When I added that repos the intention was to have that code
only running inside the first boot initrd and that code is replaced by
mkinitrd from RHEL which means it allows me to use non RHEL components
for the first boot which is important for the common boot code parts

&gt;<i> I would like to use the remote repositories(special packages) only for creating the boot image. I would like the system image to be as close to the distribution of choice as possible (I,e not using any re-compiled packages). Adding the remote repositories to system image configuration defeats this purpose (because the system image will also pick up the re-compiled packages in the remote repositories).
</I>
I agree that's why I used the http URI mentioned above only as part of the
RHEL boot image description but that information is not evaluated by obs
at the moment. iirc obs maintains a static list of packages here and has
no real connection to the boot image XML description.

If obs will take a look into that description as well I will change all
the http URI's into correct <A HREF="opensuse://">opensuse://</A> URI's. That will also be no
problem for local kiwi building because I have mapping table for this
one modules/KIWIURL.txt 

Regards,
Marcus
