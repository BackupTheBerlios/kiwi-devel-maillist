 Congratulations ! You made it and can now use Amazons storage and
 computing power.
 
-\section{Flavours}

-As already said a normal user can't upload and register kernel and/or
-initrd images at Amazon. Amazon prefers to have these in the hands of
-trusted parties only. Novell partners with Amazon in a way which allows
-us to create all types of bundles as listed in the table above so you
-are on the right side of live to be with Novell/SUSE. Considering the
-possibility you also have an Amazon account and the tools which allows
-you to upload and register kernel and initrd bundles too the following
-section describes how to create them with kiwi.

-\subsection{Amazon boot/kernel images}
-
-To instruct kiwi to create a boot image and the corresponding
-Amazon aki- and ari- bundles you only need to specify the \textbf{boot}
-attribute along with the ec2 image type. For our example this
-would look like the following:
-
-\begin{Command}{12cm}
-\begin{verbatim}
-&lt;type ... boot=&quot;xenboot/suse-11.0&quot;&gt;ec2&lt;/type&gt;
-\end{verbatim}
-\end{Command} 
-
-As you know the ec2 service is based on Xen we need to create a
-xenboot boot image with kiwi. Any other boot image will not work.
-Given that information the kiwi create step will automatically
-build the xenboot boot image and uses the Amazon provided tools
-to create the aki/ari bundles from it. As result you will see
-two additional manifest files with the prefixes
-
-\begin{itemize}
-\item &lt;initrd-name&gt;.ari.manifest.xml
-\item &lt;initrd-name&gt;.kernel.aki.manifest.xml
-\end{itemize}
-
-These images can be uploaded and registered in the same way than
-it was described for the system image (ami). To use your instance
-with your own kernel and initrd you only need to specify the
-registered ari/aki ID's along with the ec2-run-instances call.
-Please always have in mind that the kernel version of the ami must
-match the kernel version of the corresponding aki and ari image.
